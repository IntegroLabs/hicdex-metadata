{"description": "When writing this, in 2021, I am an 11 year old artist.  I am a young girl from a small rural town in the mid-west USA and my great-aunt lets me use her studio and computer.  I am very lucky because other kids around here are not much exposed to various arts or artist.  It is great being a part of an art community like this!", "identicon": "ipfs://QmeyVE98wphqAU3NouvcuSz56qSi4KKRyg7UwF73fbr6ok"}

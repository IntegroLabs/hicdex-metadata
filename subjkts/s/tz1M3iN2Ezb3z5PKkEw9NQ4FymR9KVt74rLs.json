{"description":"The collective excels at conceiving tailored-made, live in situ performances, which reveal a transmedial synaesthetic visual language. Thus placing the audience at the heart of their performance, The Shaders create a phenomenological experience, epitomising the collective and societal dimension of the festive party spirit that inspires their creations."}

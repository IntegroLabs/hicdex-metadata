{"description": "Visual artist who has been designing specific \u00ab\u00a0brush\u00a0\u00bb (a custom computer software in C++) capable of lacerating video flows by slicing only the moving parts. These forms in constant evolution are then used as a stencil shape. Like on a Praxinoscope, each fragment is added on a loop. In the lineage of the \"poster artists\" of the 1960s, by laceration, by accumulation, his works make coexist multiple temporalities."}

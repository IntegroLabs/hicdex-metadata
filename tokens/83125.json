He's one of my most beloved friends. He's been here illegally, working for contractors and ranchers for 26 years without proper representation as a citizen. At 64 he still works construction and paints. This is one of my tributes to the man who represents so many others in his situation.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmecVVhgcd9owzDRhvxRaWADMQWbh94b5ja26RiZHTwuKV","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1bRDpFK83NMSWL6jqaYqdunWFkwx2FBqJA"],"tags":[""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmecVVhgcd9owzDRhvxRaWADMQWbh94b5ja26RiZHTwuKV"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmaL7PpsjoNaxT7EoUFKRpPzcFmwM2xqKdpVx661guJdgg"},"supply":"1","transfered":1}

What is more terrifying is the fear of death. The fear of death makes us besides suffering. It also makes us refuse to prepare for death.

For this is the only way for us to find peace when the end comes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXzEro3PdRNxqs5reaZZyZdTLp6NEcXws41L5JNoQcgij", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1SWaXdv6w9HwKg2rZADnHpBeTKCAHQ4Uxs"], "tags": ["skull", "life", "Disintegrate", "fall", "broken", "hurt", "dead", "died", "hope"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmXzEro3PdRNxqs5reaZZyZdTLp6NEcXws41L5JNoQcgij"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmbopbUNpUNEqh5YRb2R6ezaZYd8ouobhRsmrGtRANGLnX"}, "supply": "10", "transfered": 10}

Apply animated noise to it on the Z axis. Take a gradient of maximum chroma and medium lightness colors, similar to a rainbow, and map it to the elevation view of the noisy plane. Then render the animation, and you get something like this. This could be compared to a geographic elevation map, but with color gradients between lines. It could also be compared to a representation of earth layer evolution.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdsmbiFTkfACkRLzbTkmDRjXphLEvui6vTP7v2RYm8JN3","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1art8z8LXimWdV44CQiXCnMYk6EwFFZsyv"],"tags":["objkt4objkt","3D","rainbow","colorful","gradient","terrain","map","geography","earth","mountain"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmdsmbiFTkfACkRLzbTkmDRjXphLEvui6vTP7v2RYm8JN3"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmUWugvW7UiTqXv82RcpiwchpSaFa6ncssSobuokUPWUYw"},"supply":"650","transfered":650}

Pictures, especially photographs, are a representation of subjects, not the subjects themselves. There is really a whole dimension of information and context, something that can not be reconstructed, missing from the subject, when looking at a representation of it. This work takes this loss one step further, and removes one more dimension from the photograph, bringing this to a level of perversion.

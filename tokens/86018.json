When imagining the concept of thinking, I imagine my thoughts freely float and bounce from thinking about one thing to another, forming concepts, evolving ideas and sometimes they can get us stuck to sticky conclusions. Think. Stand up for your thoughts. Find poisons and fight evil. Heal the world. Because your thoughts are the weapons the world needs right now. I dedicated this artwork to all of you. One of the most iconic architecture I captured in Amsterdam.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmY2XRwGdRhbKmDtsGyJk5DAY1iF1VK6RdWmgx84bR1wmd","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1ZLdssHoFmvCMBcPA4egvUidMgY3FHi1pe"],"tags":["Bubblegum","Planet","Astrology","Abstract","Photography","Art","CleanNFT","ContemporaryArt"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmY2XRwGdRhbKmDtsGyJk5DAY1iF1VK6RdWmgx84bR1wmd"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmSqFGcKskEJNP1tWmTcHPYwTYJc2Bkadou1Ey5NptPNzC"},"supply":"100","transfered":49}

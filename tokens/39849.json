The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWVsqf7X1Sn1yxiptPRP7wJsJJ51D5n4mCmusEibRj6yp","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1ft8ZPvFdcsMa2LyyA4h53Mm61bRHXBMfc"],"tags":["ALGORITM","ART","GENERATIVE","RANDOM","GIF"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmWVsqf7X1Sn1yxiptPRP7wJsJJ51D5n4mCmusEibRj6yp"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmeyonQCD5d4oMpGXbUFx3vazsnr5RxTKrDJUNFakm1uuG"},"supply":"1","transfered":2}

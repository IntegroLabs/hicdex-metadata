  "description": "One of the original buyers will get a signed 10x10\" archival metallic print. A study of hands and gestures in computational art. This is part of a set of two â€” the other is (Give/Take). Hand gestures have many meanings, but also real consequences. They can give, take; strike, caress.  From a series of works using computer vision software to detect and draw hands which were then live drawn as part of a performance using extruded strokes and a drawing pen. Redered first using livecoding system Fluxus and then rendered using Blender (for some nice ray-tracing). Original exhibition catalog at http://content.flkr.com/waving-drowning_web.pdf",

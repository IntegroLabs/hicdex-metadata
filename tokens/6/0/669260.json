This is something a little different. Sometimes my mind wanders off into uncharted territory and I find myself here, seeing this image in my mind. Seems simple enough, a line with arrows at both ends, right? True, but it is also a visual palindrome, meaning you flip the book upside down and it'll say the same thing; fun fact, if you look carefully the bottom it looks like it says \"dn & dn\". The reality is that it's \"up & up\", just upside down to read \"dn & dn\", which happens to be it's exact opposite meaning. Wait what? Turn the book upside down and check it out. Pretty rare to see a word that when physically flipped upside down becomes the negation of the original word. What words can you think of that can do this?

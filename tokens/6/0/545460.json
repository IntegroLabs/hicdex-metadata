I always imagine creating various fictional characters who might be part of or involved in the news that is being read. The fictional character could be the suspect, the victim, or the mastermind. It's fun to imagine the forms of those fictional characters who can enter a news story. But it's funny how today, when reading newspapers has been replaced by scrolling on social media (especially Twitter), news today can be consumed lightly.\n\nI've been thinking about when I can read the news directly from the newspaper because the activity itself has never been a habit for me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmeu5UTAaNq3hpbW7W64WxeLg2uiUkN8yjusr9Ao7m9uW1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSgpp8KbkbU6jA6r2VxXPm6964mYqUoVihvFvvs36JXbA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmeu5UTAaNq3hpbW7W64WxeLg2uiUkN8yjusr9Ao7m9uW1", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hzAsBJzifph6288TAmwSZsW94pgK8fWAz"], "tags": ["Drawing", "Illustrations", "Watercolor", "Fantasy", "Fictional"], "extra": {}}

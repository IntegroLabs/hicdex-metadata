{"__version": 1, "token_id": 683660, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "It\u2019s Like, You Know", "description": "\"It\u2019s Like, You Know\" is a series of paintings in which I employ an elaborately calculated process that takes into account the number of colors to be used, the quantity of each color, the number of times a color is to be used, along with the dimensions of the painting. I sometimes work with weight, but more importantly, I attempt to clean the brush while filling up the canvas. And I always fail. The brush works faster dry than clean and the canvas is never really full.

Is it something on which we can all agree? Is it the symbol for logical positivism, based on science, or absolute truth?\n\n\u201cPositivism is using brief, clear, concise discussion and does not use a descriptive story from human feelings or subjective interpretation. It does not allow any interpretation because of the value-free reason\u201d I believe it takes more than strict logic to solve problems, to arrive at consensus. \n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to be a teacher who could rotate a pink elephant 360 degrees. \n\nI envisioned a classroom where each student would come into a room and take a seat at a round table to get a unique view of the elephant. Good teaching would make sure that each learner had an opportunity to see each perspective. Voluntary inquiry would be preferred. Perhaps we could all take turns rotating the elephant. Or the table. Or our chair. \n\nThere are many chairs. I hope we all get an opportunity to share our perspectives and have more conversations and discussions to arrive at collective understanding. \n\nMy Liberal Arts degree has proven useful. \n\nKeep truth alive. \n\nI\u2019ve been playing with glitch art this season. This is the original. \nI remixed a version for Glitch Around My Way, a collection on Polygon. https://opensea.io/collection/glitcharoundmyway\n\nNFT owner has the right to resell the art NFT, to publicly perform and privately or publicly display the art.

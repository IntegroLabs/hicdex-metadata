DMT (Digital Mixed Technique) is a means of enhancing images taken from the physical world, adding extra information in order to find and accentuate the hidden connections. DMTs bridge the gap between traditional ways of making art and the use of the new tools available in and made possible by the digital realm. Their purpose is to make visible the underlying structure of reality and the patterns it consists of. Surprising connections are meant to challenge the mind like the sound of one hand clapping.","tags":["diditalmixedtechnique","dmt","crossoverart","remodernism","nft","cryptoart"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmY3HknKDdbYq5AV96yNdG5Erto7QM2gJ73rCRg315mSwf"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmY3HknKDdbYq5AV96yNdG5Erto7QM2gJ73rCRg315mSwf","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

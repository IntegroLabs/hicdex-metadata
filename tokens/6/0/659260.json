Screenshot, 1920X1080, JPEG\nIn 2013, Russian citizen Ekaterina Ustyuzhaninova killed a Libyan Army officer avenging the execution of Gaddafi. This event provoked an armed attack on the Russian embassy in Libya, which was then evacuated urgently. In the subject of the news reports I recognized a girl who used to be my dormitory roommate. A few years later I found her blocked diary in Web Archive, she wrote under the pseudonym \"Kahegha\" (a concept from the fictional worlds of Lovecraft), and that finding triggered me for creating this work.\nAlbina Mokhryakova twice won the award for \u201cYoung Artist.

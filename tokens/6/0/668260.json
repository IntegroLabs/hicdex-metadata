Piggy backing on yesterdays design Day 137 is a montage of a handful of photos I took while I was living in New York City. When I wasn't working I would walk around the city taking photos of all kinds of things including street art and graffiti. The main image in todays design was a wheat paste poster of these rabbits and I  haven't the slightest idea of who made it. That's the thing about street art. You put it out there and then it takes on a life of its own. It gets weathered, it gets ripped down, it gets photographed, and then it's gone. So even though the actual art wasn't mine the chances that this still exists is probably zero... so I've immortalized this rabbit within my collage and once it's on the block chain no amount of weather or human intervention will ever be able to erase it this time.

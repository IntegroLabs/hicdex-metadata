This trip is a Voroni diagram, 4000 polygons, 842 photos, 1MB per plane, 112,112 coordinate lines. All travel to space is nonsense. But we all want to travel to Mars. Space travel is our future salvation. We know that when we destroy this planet, when it is exhausted, we can do the same with another. And mars is the closest we have. HiRISE is the high resolution camera that travels aboard the MRO probe, it has been taking pictures since 2008 of the red planet, photos that add images to our distorted idea of this planet. The Mars voyage is yet another distortion. The mars voyage exists thanks to NASA / JPL / University of Arizona that has put in the public domain the graphic material that HiRISE has captured for us.

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 145960, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Mermaid", "description": "An estimated number of 35,000 to 100,000 women were executed between 1450 - 1750 for witchcraft and similar \"crimes\". In many cases, being too influential, having an affair with someone, or simply being different was enough to be deemed a witch and stand \"trial\". These trials would almost certainly result in death. In my mind, the drowning of these witches, is the origin story of Mermaids, who lure innocent men to their demise with wailing and song. I personally believe the image of the woman under water coming back to haunt the men is a powerful projection of the ghosts of these executed women. May there be peace found in this everlasting cycle and rest for the souls of these innocent beings.

Ironically, the district was previously known to be the richest and the most densely populated. As we know, the district's name was taken from the myth of the ancient city that was full of gold. Now the area is contaminated by radiation and inhabited by scavengers, poor people, and assassins only. It is also just the area of biochemical factories. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRMGWo2dxVhuVebxdsHnUt7upe4C6inNALvQLGboatXi9", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd9c8DFP6rggTB8oLfzrcMKJm47VH9Hkk37xbakgS4wtH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRMGWo2dxVhuVebxdsHnUt7upe4C6inNALvQLGboatXi9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gdRN1XcDeEpsP8KHDy9nc8c1JPBvCerde"], "tags": ["lucidcity", "isapanicmonsta", "illustration", "dystopian", "fantasy", ""], "extra": {}}

She the only Naiad not in Diana’s band. Often her sisters would say: \"Pick up a javelin, or bristling quiver, and interrupt your leisure for the chase!\" But she would not pick up a javelin or arrows, nor trade leisure for the chase. Instead she would bathe her beautiful limbs and tend to her hair, with her waters as a mirror.  — Ovid, Metamorphoses.

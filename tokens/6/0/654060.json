The pixels are recombined in a different resolution with the same area. Half of it is inverted, then reconverted to 256 x 256. This procedure can be repeated up to 8 times.\n\nOut of those straightforward steps and strict rules, highly complex and completely distinct patterns emerge.\n\n256x256x256x256 is a generative series created by Leston (@matheusleston)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUy5QcYoPhCmHGXJmF58E5j8bX8PCTq8CJNXTU133vT8x", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdrLsua7EUmPT8R4L83qcxgST7qZ7Gw4UwDXnGNcTkjcg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUy5QcYoPhCmHGXJmF58E5j8bX8PCTq8CJNXTU133vT8x", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1eZv3NVo44c2LJ78pKUKabFUZABemX3QMN"], "tags": ["loop", "procedural", "pixelart", "code", "math", "max/msp", "generative"], "extra": {}}

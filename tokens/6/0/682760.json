He came here not for me, but for whom exactly? And I was alone at home. But my apartment looked as though it wasn't refurbished: wallpapers straight from the 90s were on their usual place. I also noticed that the doors we threw away earlier somehow got back. Goblin was peeking at me from the door and was grinning. Then he ran. But where? I followed him and suddenly realized in terror that I wasn't alone at home after all, my mom was sleeping in the other room. Goblin bent over her and I woke up from my own screams.\n\nWhat did this Goblin symbolise? Fear of losing someone close, fear of becoming old, fear of death.

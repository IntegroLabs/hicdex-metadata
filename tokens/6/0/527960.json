This artwork was submitted for the Crypto Calaveras project contest and it's about finding life even in death, the style and color palette of the piece are inspired in the typical Mexican \"ofrendas\" in which we honor and pay tribute to those who are no longer here, the flowers that are emerging from the skull are a symbol of the life that keeps coming after death, these represent also the beautiful memories that remain of our loved ones and those feelings that keep them alive in our hearts.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbeX6Si2YUcwicxzbg9sF46q6eRWMGNs6RckXLFmE3VE9", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdw8JqL5Wb3VLavVXdKCiB57dEYt2Fnokpy7YUckJyHeA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbeX6Si2YUcwicxzbg9sF46q6eRWMGNs6RckXLFmE3VE9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ccfZCsi5p6LWnmpGRYaVz83Um3119LM9x"], "tags": ["calavera", "calaca", "skull", "cr\u00e1neo", "d\u00edademuertos", "dayofthedeath", "trippyart", "colorful", "latinamericanart", "mexicanart", "mexicantraditions", "\u00f1ft"], "extra": {}}

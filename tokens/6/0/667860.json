Along with the infinite sea of stars, it is possible to see the half moon shining in the sky, as well as some shooting stars.\n\n\nAbout the artist\n\nHi, my name is Daniela, but you can call me Dani. I am a dreamer female artist who lives in Brazil. My biggest dream is to live through my art and my creativity, and also to help make the world a fairer place for people and animals. If all goes well, I even intend to create shelters that are cozy and heavenly for abandoned or needy animals.\nI am currently in college, studying Visual Arts. I also love writing and playing the piano. I love animals a lot, including dinosaurs and the mythical ones like dragons.\nMy Twitter account: @danihp_art\nMy Instagram art account: @dani_hp_art", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPrk7AjujZbee4CgHgmUsagNUkxJpqzHiL3AmLeHwY2jC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWRL7mZ983HEiR4meLHSY78ttCxcmPcdLuTfC1WqmNDTB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPrk7AjujZbee4CgHgmUsagNUkxJpqzHiL3AmLeHwY2jC", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MnL9oSz51vjrnFNt3oF3NQ6mfm6UoeSzQ"], "tags": ["cat", "kitty", "cats", "animal", "kitten", "animals", "cute", "mystical", "magic", "galaxy", "dream", "purple", "art", "aesthetic", "starry", "nightsky", "sky", "universe", "moon", "digitalart", "digitalpainting", "dreamy", ""], "extra": {}}

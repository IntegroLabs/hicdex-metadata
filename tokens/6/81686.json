It’s an ethos for the unstable world we all live in now. As an ethos for life, it means understanding what’s really important & not giving it up. It means taking brave, smart risks and looking at the long term return. It also means hodling your nerve when people think you’re nuts. A series of 4 flavors, this one is inspired by taste memories from artists in the h=n community.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUPJmAtZEdSLV1MvgsK7UZcuTQp7ScLPuXu9PU1PXdEN4","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1iEBj6JB2iKDUCg2DPcyxbB3p9caVPr7Sd"],"tags":["cake","food","cute","kawaii","3D","apple","caramel","green"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmUPJmAtZEdSLV1MvgsK7UZcuTQp7ScLPuXu9PU1PXdEN4"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmQuLeVD1VbH5m6HH8iFzBDxdPH7sZxT8e3hEu8zJ4MCjw"},"supply":"1","transfered":1}

Our judgements make the world seem so much worse than it actually is. This is the fourth of a four part picture series in which Judgements_1, Judgements_2, Judgements_3 are a part of a bigger picture revealed in Judgements_4. The series is a quick reminder of resisting our judgements, for what we may not understand in part could make sense if only we knew the whole.", "tags": ["Judgements", "photoart", "nft", "partsofwhole", "guesstheobject", "realisation"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmXFsMQuKPNKdESe7cda3GMbnj9ur6i5XQiqaGqZ5HKCvd", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmV2sUmQpGGw8AccoxoMXEEY1Gzq2tdeWWCmakyWA1nati", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1Mcox41eg23qSqjHrHwGjCZmRyiYsPxgjX"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXFsMQuKPNKdESe7cda3GMbnj9ur6i5XQiqaGqZ5HKCvd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

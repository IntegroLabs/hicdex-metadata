Finding them can be quite difficult, but when we find them it's something special. A question I get asked all the time is: \"How do you find these words?\" There's a simple answer and a much more complex answer. I'll start with the simple answer first. There are some programs I use to enable me to speed up the process in terms of locating these words. The more complex answer is that I begin the entire process in my mind and I think about what TYPE of word I am looking for. I narrow my scope to look for very specific criteria and then begin to use computer programs to hunt them down. I then process all of the data in my head and distill it into a simplified version as what you see. So most of this happens in my head, with the aid of computers is the combined answer hopefully that you were all looking for.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbZNYHMWV3EMooa2FtvJTKfyVYsWRCSqhSvXAmAMsjVrM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUjPfxM6SEhFY9vFarQFV4KfANn5rx1NexiJzbU3NX8wy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbZNYHMWV3EMooa2FtvJTKfyVYsWRCSqhSvXAmAMsjVrM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

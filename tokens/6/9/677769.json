{"__version": 1, "token_id": 677769, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "CONNECT", "description": "From one day to the next, a virus fundamentally changed lives: public spaces remain unused and people retreat into their homes. Thoughts about the impact of this health crisis on the environment are omnipresent and also highly relevant in the profession of architecture. How will cities, collective and private spaces be affected? What will the world of tomorrow look like?\n\nThe Connect illustration presents our vision of the future, focusing on the need to bond with others and the environment, which is limited by the virus.\n\nA city no longer consists of a collection of different buildings, but develops in the form of a symbiosis. The individual buildings - as well as the individual people - always influence and complement each other.\nHowever, a connection to the environment must also be created: nature is an equally important part of this symbiosis. Architecture should be practiced in such a way that it meets and is shaped by the needs of all living things. This creates an organism that continuously absorbs and lives through change.\nIn the future, everyone will be in focus and together create a sustainable, symbiotic living environment. This process must be driven by architecture.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQRjoshtAZh5jhTtTybbDTK4geXfCwsxa7QTYzRpVCY2E", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmbjqo48mXyUSUVG2d6DoDpLvDBU6otpWK52epGNceYKYC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQRjoshtAZh5jhTtTybbDTK4geXfCwsxa7QTYzRpVCY2E", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2DAxmJuFMYed3aBCsmA1u4sUZTUYDWtnEe"], "tags": ["FutureNatureArchitectureLive"], "extra": {}}

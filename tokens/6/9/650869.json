I had in mind that\nmost of the oxygen would surely be consumed once\nthe system could be restrained into different \nmodulated parts. As far as the evolution went, \nthings looked stagger. Conclusions couldn't really\nbe put into place. Untill some passing, the bloom\nbegan to appear as an unexpected fusion of organic\nand cyber matter. Modded and reloaded, injection\npermeated the agressive takeover, and pretty soon\nbegan to show itself as a new species. Beyond expectations, \nthe emanation was around 7745.2 mhz, and measurements\ncould not fit the patterns. Untill then, reporting back.\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQfnwF452Tj3no4A92DFK53GD8C92SSE7F4xcDXHXDtHj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXJa1MFFQEUyivGyyj6uXGENTGMgcsZB862XanYy2AekJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQfnwF452Tj3no4A92DFK53GD8C92SSE7F4xcDXHXDtHj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iYNdUSLGD7kf4X8ADkZFxTMSuSfLDDn6g"], "tags": ["biokinectic", "experiment", "post-organic", "hypnacore", "poisonousflorae", "hypnacore", "REM", "7745.2mhzt"], "extra": {}}

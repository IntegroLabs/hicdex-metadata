This piece is inspired by the street children I've worked with in my local area. Despite poverty, this is one season they always look forward to. It is true to them as it is for the privileged. Be that as it may, the reality is the cold season that people enjoy is the same coldness that the less fortunate endures. Inequality is still rampant in our country. Christmas is a season of giving. My hope is to inspire people to not look the other way when meet them on the streets. To give and not only receive. To be kind always not only this Christmas season, but everyday of the year.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXXgUGXgUzbyTpGVHKNhNDDoSEWAZB94fcbWgUdaUsNru", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmREeSwkDKwkEWBodLY4eGoi9G4Tb5rwK1WuY5jTqSSAaS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXXgUGXgUzbyTpGVHKNhNDDoSEWAZB94fcbWgUdaUsNru", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fnkdweXcvgakEVJQu6nDFd1Yu6sqj7DhR"], "tags": ["Christmas", "street", "children", "cold", "season", "rat", "holiday", "poverty"], "extra": {}}

Mostly by its random but fits by my standard. Sometimes when I talk, my eyes turn and lock into the void, it\u2019s me seeing that composition.\n\nAnd one of the things that intrigued me, is a shattered glass. So many reflection, but shattered all over the place. And in my mind, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s probably how insects precieve things.\n\nAnd the reminds me, back in high school, I have a room that used to be rented. There is a mirror, it shattered. And it is painted black. I kept looking at it as if I had a painting my room by some maestro. Now that I\u2019m looking back, this thought has come up: I wonder how much the person hate themselves to brought themselves to do such thing?\n\nI might be wrong and I would never know. And I wish that glass can talk. But it\u2019s too late know, even the building is gone, replaced.\n\nThe only thing remains is the memory and the effort to put down the thought in a writing and drawing.\n\nBut, this is what existential question and the answer to it. We are all going away, sooner or later. We are all being replaced, but there will be someone that will try to find out, then they may understand.\n\nOr was it me, all along?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRGLrQwnKpLTiwFjW8QemhEzz9gjWUzwAhvhYigWDErLh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXMkGKokc5LmRRDh2HZbmFibU4k1YabqWJyLMre62qadD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRGLrQwnKpLTiwFjW8QemhEzz9gjWUzwAhvhYigWDErLh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1T1zT77dM9RnnMS2s8zEQEpF6RL96hVFNo"], "tags": ["pen", "ink", "surrealism", "paper", "broken", "door"], "extra": {}}

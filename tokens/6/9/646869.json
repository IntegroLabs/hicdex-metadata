As they carried him through the village everyone came out and placed flowers and fishing nets upon him. By the time they arrived at the docks, the whole village was there.\n\nMany kind words were said about how a greater fisherman he was and how he would be missed. Placing him on his passing boat, he was put out to sea. Prayers for his souls were spoken and sung. The flaming arrows were fired and captain Drew was on his way to Valhalla.\n\nhttps://gistlidia.xyz/saying-goodbye/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmabJz9C41BZQdomGiRctqxNCamhTSokexjgWX98EnaX1S", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmabJz9C41BZQdomGiRctqxNCamhTSokexjgWX98EnaX1S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmabJz9C41BZQdomGiRctqxNCamhTSokexjgWX98EnaX1S", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZhqH6bkJkfgdgJbWSnKhUuhPx8aaBV7TQ"], "tags": ["arrow", "Valhalla"], "extra": {}}

(ALAN WATTS)", "description": "Shocker...another incredible Alan Watts quote to lend some perspective and help change your past. (Help change my past? What are you going on about Andrew?) In a lecture many years ago, Watts said, \"We must abandon completely the notion of blaming the past for any kind of situation we're in and reverse our thinking and see that the past always flows back from the present.\" In other words, when we leave the past in the past and live in the moment, we're changing how we view the past and our interaction with it, thus changing the past's relationship with the present. (Well, that's fairly obvious Andrew.) Well, it should be, but is it though? I can think of so many people that are living in their past trying to relive their glory moments, instead of fostering new memories from new moments. Are you addicted to living in the intoxicating nostalgic past? Or are you living in the moment? Even if you wanted to, would you even know how to live in the moment? Don't let the past dictate your future.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXiQWwVqN91itm6fC8zx4yNYZqLsmEXZKgjKwcqAYYWoU", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd4HNyUy9bjNiSM7Ays8ezmxoRLi8gfti9sDKzQmfBNEh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXiQWwVqN91itm6fC8zx4yNYZqLsmEXZKgjKwcqAYYWoU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

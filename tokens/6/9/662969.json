Non-wheeled, linear skids act as landing gear. Natural fabric finish - no sealant or paint of any kind.\n\nThe Wright brothers inaugurated the aerial age with the world's first successful flights of a powered heavier-than-air flying machine. The Wright Flyer was the product of a sophisticated four-year program of research and development conducted by Wilbur and Orville Wright beginning in 1899. After building and testing three full-sized gliders, the Wrights' first powered airplane flew at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, making a 12-second flight, traveling 36 m (120 ft), with Orville piloting. The best flight of the day, with Wilbur at the controls, covered 255.6 m (852 ft) in 59 seconds.\n\nKey Accomplishment(s): First Successful Powered Airplane with a Pilot Aboard\n\nDate: 1903\n\nOn View\nCurrently on exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPD3TevGAfTYtnov8ETzZ5HYwTzBECFmRt7jo7tW8S7xC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRK3x7gp4Nt1K1wjT46NoBCUZdGHZHs34vfv3f3vxwLw5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPD3TevGAfTYtnov8ETzZ5HYwTzBECFmRt7jo7tW8S7xC", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1Z9ViyeZPU1WMQ4bXRnW2ed7DbZE63pjyB"], "tags": ["Flyer"], "extra": {}}

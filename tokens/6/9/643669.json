Cat visits are extremely frequent due to the particular view offered by the small main balcony of the central square of Little Nostalgia.\nThe environments are cozy and maintain the temperature due to its wide/thick brick walls, in addition to its two fireplaces that manage to heat the entire house in twenty minutes.\nLand measurements: 60m x 70m", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRmPiGfvE3QzdBJvCNp3Svth2BLYj98ANwKcVRTK1tNzG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRQCa13T63fWRJVzKvWQx2xtPKhRRshE6fpnCWRY1J9dW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRmPiGfvE3QzdBJvCNp3Svth2BLYj98ANwKcVRTK1tNzG", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2SpoYMTwkp9XyrciRT4AbCVu3rTX2XeZzm"], "tags": ["pink", "land", "house", "cat", "kitty", "city", "properties", "lovely", "she", "kawai", "perspective", "nostaligia"], "extra": {}}

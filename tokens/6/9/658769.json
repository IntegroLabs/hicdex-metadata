Schools and businesses close. Families come together. Everyone goes outside to enjoy and experience it. There is more laughter and play. The normal concerns of day to day life are forgotten in the wonder of nature. The world becomes quieter in the pause.\n\nThere is a sense of calm when sitting inside a warm and cozy house watching the flakes fall from the sky.

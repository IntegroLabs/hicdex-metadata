{"__version": 1, "token_id": 656669, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "confused colours", "description": "Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perceptual property corresponding in humans to the categories called blue, green, red, etc. Color derives from the spectrum of light (distribution of light power versus wavelength) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the light receptors. Color categories and physical specifications of color are also associated with objects or materials based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By defining a color space colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates.\n\nBecause perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance.\n\nThe science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science. It includes the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what is commonly referred to simply as light).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUuFXTmvguarrQJEMywNF6rRMsdCzsoTwTnDznHN5GGkv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU2JPVHxwkuYoKEhVJYnFQc1EMYj2n35VW2gn9aPihwp9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUuFXTmvguarrQJEMywNF6rRMsdCzsoTwTnDznHN5GGkv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UwhvoxH3Vj1ikZ8ddEUM9mKaV81VR59rE"], "tags": ["art", "color", "colour", "chromatic", "vivid", "painting", "hen", "hicetnunc"], "extra": {}}

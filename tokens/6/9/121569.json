I punched up the contrast and exposure a bit in post. These abstract expressionist photo \"paintings\" were my favorite of the set. I like that this one reminds me of one of my favorite painters: Rothko.","tags":["photo","photography","abstract","abstractexpressionism","expressionist","colorfield"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmNWn1Y92MBAZMJaZsXXbbvVa8LkpdWFfcwGWMYnTGHdAU","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNWn1Y92MBAZMJaZsXXbbvVa8LkpdWFfcwGWMYnTGHdAU","display_uri":"ipfs://QmR7mYxVM52jg4ANdb27ewHSUejqzqgFpAmVhRbuTPn7R4","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

In Art for All, the machine itself becomes the artist. Trained on the entire oeuvre of William Morris, the AI is able to create entirely new designs. The \u2018robot Morris\u2019, unlike the human designer, can create an infinite images, forever. Rather than static wallpaper, the AI is able to create a constantly changing and evolving pattern. The concrete details of the human design are replaced by abstraction, and the colours intensified.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUyGXbNRmuBLUNJQXBBKs493Pj3RuJ23Qqy9rRgRzbBJu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQkWmZTtWt9UGERc2nm82W3KLttoQDMt1Y2mxLBHdbXo8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUyGXbNRmuBLUNJQXBBKs493Pj3RuJ23Qqy9rRgRzbBJu", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz29Rja89EHA5G9MFzkiHtsR859LuEzXT5dk"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

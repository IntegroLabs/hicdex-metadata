Story: We reborn every single day. We have a new life, a new beginning every day. The past is gone and it's dead. You can't change it. The future is a mere prediction. It's fictional. No one has seen it. It can change at any time. Why do we worry about the things that have happened in the past and get sad by them when we have no power to change it? Why do we think about the future and worry when no one can guarantee it? These things are the surrounding of our mind which always control our thinking process. We have no control over our past and future. What we have is present so please don't waste it on the past or future. Live the moments you have because the present is what that matters. We live a new life every day. Make it the best one yet.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXJvsDi4MySGGGqYWE6P1ko9kkfd7wFfeMXuqBdhDAcwU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmamKmd5SwYN8aSdaCw1EVvtAhjEye99dTmpb4m7b4cyAF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXJvsDi4MySGGGqYWE6P1ko9kkfd7wFfeMXuqBdhDAcwU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZcurbmZ7Ndsp5kt7ZnKviKtodqJg26XsV"], "tags": ["HENthousand", "hen10k", "HENthousandLeft", "#9999LEFT", "#HENthousand", "9999LEFT", "#hen10k", "fantasy", "artwork", "dheeraj", "JohnKarel"], "extra": {}}

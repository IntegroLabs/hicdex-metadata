When I captured it I was sure that this is what I would do for the rest of my life. I was still at university and I happened to have the camera, which I consider my first good photo. I like how the woman fixes her gaze in my direction crossing the sensitive big bubble and I also like how the man in the background gets distracted and misses a beautiful image like this. Luckily I captured her and now he can go on living without guilt for missing this moment.\n\n|| twitter @gricioariel || instagram @gricioariel ||  arielgricio.com.br || \nPhotographer and visual artist from Brazil.\n\nDigital photography | 2010.\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nBy Ariel Gricio.

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 678367, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Ancient", "description": "\nOne could say this is \"Ode to The Ancient\"\nI made this to personify Ancient China. A civilization that was made more than 4000 years ago which still stand now and define what China now. A civilization that's considered to be one of the 5 earliest known today.\n\nI adore their history, culture, and philosophy. Despite their conflicts and phases of splitting-reuniting, they managed to keep the culture alive, exist, and practiced until present day unlike other earliest civilizations.  \n\nThis might raise question on why making it female in spite of Confucian core value itself that revolve around patriarchy. The point is, I want to portray the beauty and elegance while maintaining the image of authority.\n\nAlso, if you people like to look into more detail, I used Hanfu clothing design on her since Han Chinese is China's ethnic majority since she needs to represent her people. \n\nThe Hanfu also meant to symbolize Han dynasty period that is considered as its golden age which spans through 4 centuries so Ancient China is really on its peak here. To put a stress on this part, I colored the Hanfu orange-yellowish. Based on interpretation of Chinese culture yellow represents power, prosperity, and luck while orange is associated with happiness, wealth, and celebrations.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPioWDPhN5CVocGzN1h4zwbi6xMpnD8NHr6jGpX4w4uUF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUbW9zs3iFNRe575My5uQnr4tHcxPnMfhEsmmsA6DmTHb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPioWDPhN5CVocGzN1h4zwbi6xMpnD8NHr6jGpX4w4uUF", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1a1gSmvnuUtL4jHyurvgPNPgaXepCWaYhU"], "tags": ["illustration", "digitalillustration", "digitaldrawing", "anime", "ancientchina", "china", "asia", "civilization", "culture"], "extra": {}}

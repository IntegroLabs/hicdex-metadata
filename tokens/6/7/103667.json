Now, half a century later, as I share these in a digital marketplace full of artists hawking their wares, I hope these photos remind us all of the humanity behind the transactions. This photo was taken circa 1970 in what I knew then as Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka—one of my favorite places on my travels.","tags":["photo","photography","vietnam","ceylon","srilanka","1970"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmSxkodSzX2ZpuxkU5JMnrqD9Xxu6Zje4Ro5LTSp8pW1KE"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSxkodSzX2ZpuxkU5JMnrqD9Xxu6Zje4Ro5LTSp8pW1KE","display_uri":"ipfs://QmX1vUBNbz9GnVfvencQW3bLfU1Jp5JqRT2heV1QZ9k9Hd","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

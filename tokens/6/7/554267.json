They used stained glasses and the secret ways of optics to cover the core of their secrets. As 200 studied Blevroki, the stained glasses started to burn to the core of the face. 200 endured this for so long, having set it's sight to the core, it did not budge. As the stained glass made it's imprint on the face, so did the core started coming to it. In the end, the core was as strong as the embrace so it held strong but the rest of the universe wasn't. Now the universe can't detach from 200 and the core can't let go of the universe in 200 forever.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdG1YnBAemW4xqvixhafLhgsBdSxgv16Ey1keWzHJGqvc", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmed8QdLdWd7epfrxfc3GrjQtVL2MaDfCVb4c6BkR3sEyw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmRee1mPbRM2T5YsscYtnConF7NUynCvJ1bG5ghno5L3QQ", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdG1YnBAemW4xqvixhafLhgsBdSxgv16Ey1keWzHJGqvc", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1dFdr2eUt9hCRn9F2CQrFNt4rJubuAittQ"], "tags": ["fractalfaces"], "extra": {}}

I get a lot of joy from creating clean, precise, happy, negative space illustrations. A lot of my art is emotionally taxing to create and heavier to view. It feels as though allowing myself to indulge in this style, my second love after surreal oil painting, I'm saying it's ok to not be so serious all the time. It's ok to have some fun too. I hope this creation gives you as much joy as it gave me to create it.","tags":["speaknoevil","illustration","graphic","digital","minimal","negativespace","animated","fun","summer","goodvibes",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmYfpMKrSuXLjiTYCHqQVLJ8yzCq46tNmq2dxbMN6pPDzw"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYfpMKrSuXLjiTYCHqQVLJ8yzCq46tNmq2dxbMN6pPDzw","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

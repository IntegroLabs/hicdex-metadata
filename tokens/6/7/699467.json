This is a handcrafted ash imprint that I made on March 11, 2021. The full size of the print is 50x65cm. This is the case when the form resembles abstract art. It was completely created by Nature and I transferred it to paper without a single change and preserving all the details.\n \nSometimes, depending on the imprints and associations that I have, looking at them, I give my works names.\n \nGinnungagap is the primary chaos, the world's abyss in Scandinavian mythology.  It itself is devoid of life, but initially two worlds arose there - Niflheim and Muspelheim, and from their interaction in the void of the world's abyss, a primordial being was born - the giant Ymir.\n \nAnd as I wrote under the first work from this series, first of all, I want you to print out this work and decorate your house. Thus, we will continue the amazing path of this ash, even after its end.\n \nThe print was made on acid-free paper with acrylic ink and was converted to digital format using high-quality scanning.\n \n| Digital characteristics:  JPEG, 7817x9941 pixels, 400 DPI |", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW6r3iY5xMxsJtkV5TMzrzBrGvHZgFrtoUWNPFFG3CGMV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ5aa4mL7S1K7jvRRiGV2jRCxjey41HEoZjfFPjvQf5AB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW6r3iY5xMxsJtkV5TMzrzBrGvHZgFrtoUWNPFFG3CGMV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NB3Pr5WYq74BkMzKGY2EZb32SqhGCG6ue"], "tags": ["imprint", "abstract", "art", "print", "paper", "painting", "color", "wood", "acrylic", "forest", "paint", "tree", "nature", "scan", "darkart", "beautiful", "object", "life"], "extra": {}}

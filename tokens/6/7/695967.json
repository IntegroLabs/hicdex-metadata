Normally this would be no big deal 'cept tonight the Oldsmobile is in the impound yard. \n\nWhat to do? What to do?\n\nWell after running your hands through your mullet in exasperation you call your best chum, Hesher. He's always up for an adventure and says he'll pick you up in his loud ass van, which you hear pulling up at this very moment. \n\nSo, Hesher's old lady gonna watch the kid. You grab the bolt cutters and a bag of meat for that mean old junkyard dog at the impound yard, relight your joint and scram. \n\nFull speed ahead, metal blaring, Your off into the muggy florescent summer night. Hoping the dog takes the meat cuz the first aid kit is also in that #@$% Oldsmobile!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ2TD9zFctko3yPY4DzeT3GPHPcAR5q4GRLiisG3Fsq6f", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSTyxTVMnNBjqgRnPDQneTiCmzT3Di3KmeFGdL1KUWvcz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ2TD9zFctko3yPY4DzeT3GPHPcAR5q4GRLiisG3Fsq6f", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1KxjakCmqHhSEs1CCw7Uo1d2cnp38WfVmw"], "tags": ["oldsmobile", "rottweiler", "night", "sleep", "mullet", "caper", "broccoli", "companion", "florescent", "joint", "blaring", "glare", "oldlady", "meat", "speed", "metal", "boltcutters", "junkyard", "dog", "hesher", "headbanger", "muggy", "scram"], "extra": {}}

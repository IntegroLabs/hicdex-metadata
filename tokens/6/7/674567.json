I had decided to call this NFT \"Blue Fluff\". However, I noticed that the art underwent a tonality change on the cell phone screen compared to the notebook screen, and the cat appeared to have more purplish tones instead of blue. I would call the NFT \"Purple Fluff\", but I decided it would be better to simply call it \"Magic Fluff\". So now we have the mystery of the fluffy magic cat, which we don't know for sure if it's more purple or more blue.\n\nAbout the artist\n\nHi, my name is Daniela, but you can call me Dani. I am a dreamer female artist who lives in Brazil. My biggest dream is to live through my art and my creativity, and also to help make the world a fairer place for people and animals. If all goes well, I even intend to create shelters that are cozy and heavenly for abandoned or needy animals.\nI am currently in college, studying Visual Arts. I also love writing and playing the piano. I love animals a lot, including dinosaurs and the mythical ones like dragons.\nMy Twitter account: @danihp_art\nMy Instagram art account: @dani_hp_art", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP2K1oEKvZgwDns9aoDK4eu7rQLWk1bXvQEijjz8ccRUy", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd9jJup8PeKLNTRTJdLnWcL6LYrsLgtVFDRBHTzignt2F", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP2K1oEKvZgwDns9aoDK4eu7rQLWk1bXvQEijjz8ccRUy", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MnL9oSz51vjrnFNt3oF3NQ6mfm6UoeSzQ"], "tags": ["cat", "kitty", "kitten", "cats", "animal", "animals", "magic", "dream", "dreamy", "colorful", "mystical", "purple", "blue", "mystery", "galaxy", "feline", "art", "artwork", "digitalart", "fantasy", "mysticart", "mystic"], "extra": {}}

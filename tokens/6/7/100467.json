Your generosity and tenacity for production is an inspiration for us all. My foray into acid music was catalyzed through your contributions.   Our collaborations were small and short but you and your music have left a lasting imprint on me and many others. Here’s a visualization of this imprint through steganography and spectrography. I wish I could have shown you this while you were still here.   Maybe it will reach you in the All. | Proceeds go to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (nami.org). |  “I don’t need to hang out with techbros in a tutu to let my freak flag fly, Acid taught me to fly that motherfucker erry day.” - JaseIsThePlace, #gently-used, 02.27.21","tags":["JasenLoveland","AndrewSmith","TheLoneFlanger","InfiniteRefractions","MidiMaster","E.C.C.O.","AceOfFades","DJKline","AcidMusikDepartment","ChipCurtis","TheChoice","JL-303","TheLimit","TimelineOfTheFarFuture","Pervocet","Steganography","Spectrography","InfiniteLove","InfiniteRefractions"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmTHFexiMtwWSWyRGKmkRDLsJMFgjUco7k3JzrHYZYiHdK"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTHFexiMtwWSWyRGKmkRDLsJMFgjUco7k3JzrHYZYiHdK","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTLuhTbBwah5h8kT9Pm6RXSzkPyZkzYhwZutqCRVkBScR","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

This art is the transmission of my fear of water and my inability to keep afloat. Yes, yes, I can't keep afloat and probably float altogether, lol. I can swim a few meters and drown, fear of not feeling the bottom. When I was creating this work, it seemed to me that the fear had disappeared somewhere, either from the fact that you are immersed in a problem, or from the fact that it looks a little different. But the message is quite simple - fight your fears by any means. I started.

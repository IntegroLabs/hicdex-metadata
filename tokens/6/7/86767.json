It’s an ethos for the unstable world we all live in now. As an ethos for life, it means understanding what’s really important & not giving it up. It means taking brave, smart risks and looking at the long term return. It also means hodling your nerve when people think you’re nuts. A series of 4 flavors, this one is spicy chai and fresh banana flavor, with banana & vanilla frosting.","tags":["cake","food","cute","kawaii","3D","yellow","banana","chai"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmTktj5iYkgKLzaefcGyMtqpd4Pwy8uf2GgJC2Sbfgw9mW"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTktj5iYkgKLzaefcGyMtqpd4Pwy8uf2GgJC2Sbfgw9mW","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

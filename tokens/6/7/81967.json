It was reported to have more than 1000 lightning strikes in 3 hours. During the storm, I visualized a woman crying waterfall tears. It was as if all the frustration and anger that was inside of me was in that visualization. I think she is crying for everyone who has being pushing themselvesâ€”especially those of us who lived in survival mode for most of their lives. \"Llorando por el Mundo\" means weeping for the world.","tags":["drawing","illustration","ink","circlism","weepingfortheworld","crying","llorando","darkart","survivor","woman","mujer","strivera"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmVYHLDJcmB6W99me7eEzS43kaCfYkhRRMyjdJogPjSnnj"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVYHLDJcmB6W99me7eEzS43kaCfYkhRRMyjdJogPjSnnj","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

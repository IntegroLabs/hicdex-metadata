Different shades of green painting the surface. The breeze that moves the grass, the sun that illuminates it.\nPerhaps by accident, perhaps by intention, but always by carelessness, one day everything changed. One spark was enough to turn all the life generated over the years to ashes. The flames took over the body and the black cloak of death covered everything.\n\nSilence.\nDarkness.\nA time that seems not to advance.\nSunbeams that get caught in the ashes.\nThe life that, fearful, wonders whether to go out again, or if it was really the end.\n\n\nHow did the fire originate? Who is guilty? Why did it happen?\n\n\nQuestions that resonate in the body. Questions without answer. A culprit that does not have a human face, a culprit that is within each person. We were all responsible for killing it. And now we're also responsible for reviving it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR5cyPb7oTm7U7pNGAaC43VzHopfHFLhsxaqSkEFMrDiw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXNQXL6sSsV3q7xp8wFgRABRSrVqAkHsTpcdC5YbRY7jA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR5cyPb7oTm7U7pNGAaC43VzHopfHFLhsxaqSkEFMrDiw", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PmqDmfxWZQnhMmstr6DCydyzhDMdELsw8"], "tags": ["Sculpture"], "extra": {}}

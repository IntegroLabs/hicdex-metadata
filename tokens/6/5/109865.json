The fascinating part of this unannounced release was not the art work or how many collectors purchased, but the minting itself. This picture shows Pak is one of us by also experiencing backtracks when minting an objkt! So keep with it and don't be put off, this happens to the best of us. Shout out to _Fatberg_Slim and Hen House who noticed this activity immediately.

The first fifty years and the clock to measure them.\nThe shape in the middle is the clock made by engineer Pedro Ruiz Gallo (1834-1880). Built in 1870, the mechanical device was exhibited in the Lima International Exhibition, held in 1872, as part of the year-long celebration for the fifty years of the nascent Peruvian republic. The exhibition was placed, quite simbolically, in the Parque de la Exposicion (park of exhibitions) built in part of the terrain from the- previously demolished- colonial city walls. Around ten years later, the clock's machinery was destroyed when the city was occupied during the Pacific war of 1879-1883 (between Chile, Peru and Bolivia).\nauthor: gefercan filetype: mp4/mkv size: 1280x1280 px length: 30 sec.(aprox)\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfJwbHKtBvy761cSjmHrZ6XVWz4mC682WWgSDEd1HiEAZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdmPy49TboGHWi5aDXEGGNUD3KYrHN6DEMFGntMnBhVXj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfJwbHKtBvy761cSjmHrZ6XVWz4mC682WWgSDEd1HiEAZ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iKH4CTP853rcsriUEKGvF2TKkXMxVCB1k"], "tags": ["videoart", "bicentenario", "videomoment", "videoarte", "identity", "gefercan", "time-basedart", "motionimage"], "extra": {}}

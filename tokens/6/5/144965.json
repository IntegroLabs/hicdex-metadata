Ninja: You dare to ask that , you defeated the koga clan years ago , a single samurai defeated the entire clan ,is this a joke or something .That day you didn't killed anyone ,but left them defeated , injured and scars so deep in their soul that can never be cured. I saw my father took his own life in front my eyes. Kazan: I am sorry for your loss ,son ! But I gave them a chance to live ,I didn't killed anyone. Ninja: I will restore honor of koga clan today.

When I really like the linework I do on one, sometimes, I'm hesitant to go too wild with colour and shading-- this was one of these cases. I added a simple open-source watercolour texture and toyed with a few palette options, then left it as is. I hope you enjoy it, even if it's not as \"produced\" as some of my work.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQFpDmBxkXmevysDfQKEKA54ubMwm3pJAsdodMUPkLZ8s","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1diVU51UZnHn8ctF3yFtmGpaYAMCHPzgfB"],"tags":["illustration","woman","character","digital","conceptart","portrait","characterdesign"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmQFpDmBxkXmevysDfQKEKA54ubMwm3pJAsdodMUPkLZ8s"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmbhCZxRuuxxGDMgZ4tHoxoRbg5f7LpU1Ymq3WS9vhKbiV"},"supply":"25","transfered":51}

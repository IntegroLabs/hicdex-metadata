The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","tags":["Wolfram","Gif","Generative","Random"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmZjUSo7NH91hn56KeuJqMyr6S56gXcDKts7KqkxgSjqTH"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZjUSo7NH91hn56KeuJqMyr6S56gXcDKts7KqkxgSjqTH","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZjUSo7NH91hn56KeuJqMyr6S56gXcDKts7KqkxgSjqTH","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

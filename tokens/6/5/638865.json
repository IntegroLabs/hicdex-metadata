She went alone on a charter boat with a lot of people on it. The boat was mored  in a  great  spot with  a lot of colorful fish. Hawa Cat tried to catch them  to eat them, but they were smart and  swam fast. She was snorkeling with no life jacket, because in Turkey, the people are fearless. Suddenly, the boat left and it was so loud that no one could hear her cat's screams. She thought she would die and become the Milky Way. Finally, some one in a nother boat spotted her and gave her a ride back to the port of Marmaris.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTG22iwNoyDGgboFncfrKGPyFAPpCwpE7N8bzR5mWynBV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaSDme21b42XxCRQVNWubhcTrfYvgcsa4hPfmwgA56wwV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTG22iwNoyDGgboFncfrKGPyFAPpCwpE7N8bzR5mWynBV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QG5d7iZ6pW32mw5HsHCHB1Ao6u3xZ6mEV"], "tags": ["HawaCat", "FreeNFT", "Free", "FreeCat", "cat", "cats", "kittens", "marmaris", "turkey", "evehennessa", "nfteve", "NFTs", "universe", "neardeathexperience", "NDE", "milkyway", "universe", "starts", "childrens", "cute", "kittens"], "extra": {}}

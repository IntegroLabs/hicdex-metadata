{"__version": 1, "token_id": 645565, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "in ancient times an egg settled on my shoulder", "description": "\"In the morning the egg is lying on the kitchen table.\n\nI see the egg at a single glance. I immediately perceive that I cannot be simply seeing an egg. Seeing an egg is always in the present: No sooner do I see the egg than I have seen on egg, the same egg which has existed for three thousand years. The very instant an egg is seen, it becomes the memory of an egg. The only person to see an egg is someone who has seen it before. Like a man who, in order to understand the present, must have had a past. Upon seeing the egg, it is already too late: an egg seen is an egg lost. A vision that passes Iike a sudden flash of lightning. To see the egg is the promise of being able to see the egg again one day. A brief glance which cannot be divided. Does thought intervene? No, there is no thought: there is only the egg. Vision is the essential faculty and, once used, I shall cast it aside. I shall remain without the egg. The egg has no itself. Individually, it does not exist.\"\n\ntranslated from portuguese, first paragraph of the short story \"the egg and the chicken\", by the brazilian writer Clarice Lispector.

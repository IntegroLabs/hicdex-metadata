This is my first NFT in motion as well! I’ve always wanted to build up my creative energy towards a penultimate project  of sorts in which I merge all of my varied interests. I have a lot of ideas up my sleeve regarding that. You could call this digital piece my first step, or a test pilot in my grand journey towards that goal. To all those who collect this little piece of my dreamworld, just know there is so much more yet to be seen & explored. Thanks for following me to the far reaches of the galaxy.

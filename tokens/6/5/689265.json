She listens to the song of the water and is in love with the moon. The owner of Horse should desire to travel as she travels a lot and does not stay long in one place. \n\nShe has acquired a geographical knowledge of the territories of Earth from over the generations. Horse is best to help the lost find a new way.\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.

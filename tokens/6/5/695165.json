You have now :-) This is not just an AI piece of art done with a couple of clicks (none of mine are tbh), this animation has been trimmed, cut, zoomed, sharpened in three different ways, resized, and also mirrored perfectly without a single sign that its not as it was when originally made.\n\nWeeks of working this piece has left it to be what I believe is an NFT first! Welcome To The Bowels Of Hell is 1960 X 1120 in dimensions, 98.7MBs of A.I. animated MP4 art, and runs at 10 frames per second.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSYZcY5YFfD6Ns2SWURwKmzmK2TPSbfHExELeGD5zJy1m", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP9HA3eLrjWAb9PpVK5SyBwh7es7BikoG5B6geLevmjzA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSYZcY5YFfD6Ns2SWURwKmzmK2TPSbfHExELeGD5zJy1m", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1avqD59hheHb72gSbCXMAzcqMjwm2aFWPE"], "tags": ["Mirrored", "AI", "MP4", "NFT-First", "1/1"], "extra": {}}

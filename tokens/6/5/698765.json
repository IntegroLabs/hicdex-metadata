{"__version": 1, "token_id": 698765, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Boson string", "description": "It is the first and simplest form of string theory. It traditionally requires 26 dimensions to conform to physical rules and assumptions (such as Lawrence symmetry). Unfortunately, there is a tachyon (a particle that travels faster than light) in the spectrum of its particles, so it cannot be a model of nature. It also follows Bose's statistics (as opposed to Fermi in [statistical mechanics]) so it naturally cannot describe particles such as electrons. Of course, this theory succeeds in describing field particles such as gravitons and photons.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf4Z8LEtg9MF6D1geytALE1T7K4LSwZn4yhhZDyjgQsoi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPPB4u1s8BSiZ1nzQJheXondVB6kE5RicSZSEn6KwMNAJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf4Z8LEtg9MF6D1geytALE1T7K4LSwZn4yhhZDyjgQsoi", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LQBk853emar4xQ2M4mWyeciaTKytRqusC"], "tags": ["#photoshop#aftereffect#motionart#StringTheory#Bosonstring#Thegates"], "extra": {}}

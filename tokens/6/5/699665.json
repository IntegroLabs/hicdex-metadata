I was sifting through my computer looking for new/old assets for the collection and stumble upon all kinds of things that I have completely forgotten about. Whenever I get a new computer I take all the important things off the old one and dump it onto an external drive... but how often do I go back into that old content??? Not often enough. And the division of things and hierarchy make no sense. So it's not like I can find anything in there anyway. But when i do look on those old drives I find things like this old IRL collage I had made and named it \"Biznatch.\" What does that mean??? I have no idea. What was it for? Probably nothing. What does it mean now? A benchmark for development? A snapshot of the time period? A comment about how I was feeling at the time about my past relationship? I don't know. Maybe all of the above. I've been with my wife now for 15 years so it's almost like anything before I met her was another life.

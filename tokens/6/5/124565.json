Whales play a significant role in capturing carbon from the atmosphere; each great whale sequesters an estimated 33 tons of CO2 on average, thus playing their part in the fight against climate change. Unfortunately, their large size and mythical aura does not protect them; six out of the 13 great whale species are classified as endangered or vulnerable, even after decades of protection. An estimated minimum of 300,000 whales and dolphins are killed each year as a result of fisheries bycatch, while others succumb to a myriad of threats including shipping and habitat loss.\" â€“ WWF","tags":["digitalart","digitalpainting","cleannfts","endangeredspecies","whales"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmTWa95fvwK6CZM887p3BPLbQsxe1iXs7y4gPfnH9TQFJY","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTWa95fvwK6CZM887p3BPLbQsxe1iXs7y4gPfnH9TQFJY","display_uri":"ipfs://QmcKSkWj5U3wXZvs7TMg5p2DUNV2orTBu32SUFhL1wA6kx","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

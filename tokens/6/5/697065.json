{"__version": 1, "token_id": 697065, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Pillars of Dawn (single, II)", "description": "'Pillars of Dawn' is a series of prints and videos which imagine near desert landscapes in which environmental conditions have crystallised the terrain. In each of the scenarios we encounter, we see a beautiful, empty, crystallised world. It is almost as though all life-forms have been transformed into pure carbon - that is, into the most concentrated forms of pure carbon in the natural world - diamonds. The majesty and infinite wealth of the Earth is revealed, although no humans appear present to appreciate it.\n\n'Pillars of Dawn' presents us with an oblique picture of what humans\u2019 imagined monopoly rights over all territories and species leads towards. The exploitation of all natural resources, plant, animal, and mineral alike, above and below ground, will incur other kinds of debts to be repaid.\n\nUsing digital technologies, Kelly Richardson creates hyper-real, sublime, and spectacular landscapes that communicate underlying unsettling narratives. Her work asks us to consider what we truly value and where we might go from here.\n\nShe has been featured in the Beijing, Busan, Canadian, Gwangju and Montr\u00e9al biennales, as well as major moving image exhibitions internationally, including TIFF and Sundance Film Festival. Her works can be found in the permanent collections of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (USA), SMoCA (USA), Albright-Knox Art Gallery (USA), National Gallery of Canada, Art Gallery of Ontario (Canada), Mus\u00e9e d\u2019art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al (Canada), Southampton City Art Gallery (England), Towner (England), Arts Council Collection (England), among others.\n\nAll rights reserved.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeR9jk82z6hMwmHKP46tLxAJk5vd2cSUAb9jVat6djBbc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUjcCMkoDKnaRzXxYnaTA43UbDFPkfZbfSDbhwBm68oVn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeR9jk82z6hMwmHKP46tLxAJk5vd2cSUAb9jVat6djBbc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1M7n1FpvfKhByTPhW3pwbQv67Ka5YV17BC"], "tags": ["kellyrichardson", "3D", "crystals", "diamonds", "tree", "landscape", "scifi", "clifi"], "extra": {}}

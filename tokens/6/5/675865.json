{"__version": 1, "token_id": 675865, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "[Sic]_Lons_4", "description": "\u00ab[Sic]\u00bb is a project initiated during an art residency for a physical theatre play called \u00abL\u00e0 o\u00f9 nous sommes \u00bb (Where we stand), created and performed by Charlotte Braun. This first serie is therefore called [Sic_Lons]. \n\nAfter several collaborations on the project as videographer, during 2020 I was invited to join the team during two weeks of creation as \u00aboutside eye\u00bb at Cube studio-theatre, H\u00e9risson, France. The aim of it is generally to give feedback that comedians cannot get from themselves on stage. \n\nThe play deals with the question of walking in nature, slowness and the thoughts that accompany it. We see a character move through different qualities of dance movement, expressing physical and mental introspection, or conversely detachment and letting go while immersed in nature.\n\nThese photographs are a proposal seeking to capture the attentive slowing down present in the subject of the piece, but also inherent to any work of research and rehearsing. Given that creative processes are closely linked to the temporal appropriation of any medium, with its timing accuracy, long exposure photography seemed to me to be the most suitable medium.\n\nBeeing present as outside eye during this step of writing on stage was thus an opportunity to examine what makes, from the spectator\u2019s point of view, the anticipation, the reflexion, the surprise or habituation when receiving an artistic proposal. How memory within the cognition system distorts our perception of things, or is distorted by renewal.\n\nIn this sense, \u00ab[Sic]\u00bb serie represents the reception of another artist\u2019s work, as a collaborative quote of the initial artwork. Since nothing is added to the image afterwards, photography can in this case thus serve both as a faithful object to the work cited and also as a testimony of the transition between the viewer\u2019s gaze and the object observed.\n\nThe project is currently continued with other companies or artists at work or performing.\n\n\n________\n\n\n\u00abL\u00e0 o\u00f9 nous sommes\u00bb cast : Conception : Charlotte Braun / Performance : Charlotte Braun, Romain Pellegrini ( Drums ) / Drums composition : Romain Pellegrini / Sound and light creation : Audrey Ruzafa.

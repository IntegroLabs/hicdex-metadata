With this Art that I made I hope that each one of us would have the genuine feeling of concern to each and everyone that we encounter.","tags":["Digital","MentalHealthAwareness","Abstract",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmXQFZbu75KfYdqbkrAAV53xL3RpNgKjjpmfXqHXpQD7Rb"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXQFZbu75KfYdqbkrAAV53xL3RpNgKjjpmfXqHXpQD7Rb","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdTkwdP4bXaq17ocH5xYb3X4gkNqGiKrfAVa8DdyEhJPV","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

One of the 3 original buyers will get a signed 20\"x10\" print on archival metallic paper. This is an homage to Salvadore Dali's 1931 work \"The Dream,\" with a blue sky background that fades into infinity and seems to float beyond the frame of the canvas behind a soft figure defying gravity in the foreground. This slight colour fade from dark to light blue creating a feeling of gazing at a small frame of the infinite possibilities of dreams. From a series of works using computer vision software to detect and draw hands which were then live drawn as part of a performance using extruded strokes and a drawing pen. Redered first using livecoding system Fluxus and then rendered using Blender (for some nice ray-tracing).

Myth says with 100% of this power, a human could destroy earth. In ancient civilization at some point to minimize the potent of humans to destroy world, they does some kind of genetic engineering to every mother to push this power and hold the energy of it. They injected some kind of bacteria on \"Klad\" inside the brain, They succeed. Bacterias holds 97% of produced energy but lost a little bit intelligence of the brain. Scrimpy. However it does not make them foolish. And the bacteria genetically inherited to their childrens, hereditary. Nowaday we humans only use 2,5 - 4% brain capability. As an illustration, Superman's power is only 40%.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbUvnZKokxVwF7voqYi9QAaqBPb3j5LBhd2bs4MXFMH4k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbUvnZKokxVwF7voqYi9QAaqBPb3j5LBhd2bs4MXFMH4k", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbUvnZKokxVwF7voqYi9QAaqBPb3j5LBhd2bs4MXFMH4k", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1RD5KsfT3229TLPqgvMsJ6qMsFc9jvevKi"], "tags": ["gif", "mystery", "art", "darkart", "secret", ""], "extra": {}}

I personally love that half of the words involved use the word GRIFT, as if the work is stealing your attention line-by-line. 2. The execution, the extreme fading to white is another experiment that I found to be a lovely departure from the existing lexicon we've already created. GRIFTERS are everywhere in every industry and sector. There will always be people that will try to lie, cheat, and deceive you; beware of the grifters of the world. The Art World is definitely one of those industries where grifting happens at almost every single level. From the artist to the curator to the gallery to the client to the auction houses, somewhere right now a grift is happening or just happened. I'm not saying it is endemic, but it happens. Can you tell I'm slightly jaded? lol", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmei4MukrrZiTCavrM2grp237oF9cXDS1amyQShdNDp2pz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV4N2BLeY91wudZawPDw1AX5ufUFnMtfepkegGphDDf6v", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmei4MukrrZiTCavrM2grp237oF9cXDS1amyQShdNDp2pz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

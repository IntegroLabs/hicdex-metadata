Birds are flying through day and night on a never ending journey. 100/100 Edition - but each edition is always different, I made some color changing scripting on this SVG file. Check on fullscreen, this is not limited to preview. Best experience on hic et nunc collection or my website. Note! At other platforms in orange colors with flying birds.","tags":["minimalistic","minimalism","scenery","illustrations","illustration","vector","vectorart","niftyscenes"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/svg+xml","uri":"ipfs://QmWbzdfzCy3bpP9jncsqh2CbEshvrCt5muCtmfddp5L1zn"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWbzdfzCy3bpP9jncsqh2CbEshvrCt5muCtmfddp5L1zn","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNcfF3vz5M8XVhwAvJ8VufzTD2srQkVYchXvdW3ZZ55h6","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

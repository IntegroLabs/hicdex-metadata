It all started with the bodies landscape of Karl Warner.  I was incredibly impressed with the idea of ​​using photographs of the human body as a material for creating a compilation and I wanted to do something similar but with a video. I shot my girlfriend's body parts)) on the rear and then tried to create a landscape similar to Warner’s. A few hours later i done it and finally enjoy the view of how the landscape breathes. 15 minutes later I decided to experiment with colors and edition dynamic. A few hours later, my landscape turned into rave party orgy.)) I start systematically experimented - trying different combinations of shapes and movements. Over time I noticed that some of my experiments are looks like eyes, mouths, noses, like different parts of body. So, I started make faces, and then make bodies out of faces.  CRYPTO MONSTER ALBERT TOKENOVICH (psychologist) is the first of the second generation Crypto Monsters Collection.  Creation of Сrypto Monsters for me is like meditation. I dissolve as a person and become just a creator who gives each monster a piece of own soul. But when the process is over, creation takes on its own unique soul and goes its own way, a path separate from the creator.

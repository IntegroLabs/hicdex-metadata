Oh no! \n\nI wish I had a restart button. I wish I had many; calm down button, happy button, active button, falling asleep button. Unfortunately, I don't.\n\nThis is one of works in my current project. It is talking about being a human. Being a human that is so blissful and also so hard, complicated and breakable. I'm trying my best to not be broken by creating these artworks. As a human. Staying alive together.

Screenshot, 1920X1080, PNG\nThe number of young people with mental disorders is growing annually worldwide. Today we see how the desire for a stable emotional state has become an impulse for the development of various types of therapies: from pharmacological and psychotherapeutic to physical and spiritual. Immersing myself in the material, I have noticed the studies in which religious discourse is compared with pharmaceutical and psychotherapeutic discourses. Similar comparisons are found, for example, in the works of the American sociologist Philip Reef and the French philosopher Michel Foucault. Continuing their line, the composition of the video (art therapy part - a music concert, an anonymous depressive club part - a messenger with stories and a mandala\u2019s ritual) can be correlated with the principles of Christian doctrine: faith,  healing, miracle.\nAlbina Mokhryakova twice won the award for \u201cYoung Artist.

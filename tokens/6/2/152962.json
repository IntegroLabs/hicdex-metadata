{"__version": 1, "token_id": 152962, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Manifesto | NFT Community is dead ", "description": "\"Your collector will find you\" \"You'll get sales soon\" \"NFT Community is the best\" \"Only good vibes NFT Community\"  Your time will come and never comes. NFT Community is pumped by fake good vibes and toxic positivity. It's full of scammers that bully the artists and play with their dreams and wallets. Many collectors are afraid to admit that it is about the money. Some artists get fame and wallets full of ETH and leave the stage. Some artists can sell every bullshit they make because they've become big names. Yet there are a lot of more talented artists that struggle to get into the spotlight and little projects that focus on them.   Artists can't take feedback. They start hating on big names. Most of them act like beggars. The decentralised dream becomes just another pond where they choose to drown.   NFT Community is decaying because we don't want to admit that not everything we say and do is genuine and we follow our interests.  Ego beats art.  Ego beats others desires.  Ego beats the NFT Community.  Made by yours truly, FDbones!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZByYgEaKeHZ9z4d6sjm7yKs81499z5ZbBjno5SFVVg5B", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWWzY3MP2Hcyao5KuQYoYdvrDvwXiaX8ARqDUVCHMUWau", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZByYgEaKeHZ9z4d6sjm7yKs81499z5ZbBjno5SFVVg5B", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2SxZEGuvB4kAH589gfMeicz8HCe8778fD5"], "tags": ["fdboes", "darkart", "digitalillustration", "muchlovecollector"], "extra": {}}

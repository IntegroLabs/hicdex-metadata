Every time I feel some what normal, the next thing you know I\u2019d feel like crap. No matter how I hard try to get through the day, anxiety manifests itself into physical discomfort. How do I over come that?! Breathing exercises, sure it works for awhile, but then the discomfort returns. It lingers. I can\u2019t seem to surface and breathe the fresh air. Sinking, sinking to the bottom of the abyss.

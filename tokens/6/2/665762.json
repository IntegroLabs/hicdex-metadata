In addition to religious use, since ancient times Chinese pagodas have been praised for the spectacular views they offer, and many classical poems attest to the joy of scaling pagodas.\nChinese sources credit the Nepalese architect Araniko with introducing the pagoda to China.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbqtFrd9WWrPySLvQ6x68qfVa4mCFeuYnzXs7AZn3TMXM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbqtFrd9WWrPySLvQ6x68qfVa4mCFeuYnzXs7AZn3TMXM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbqtFrd9WWrPySLvQ6x68qfVa4mCFeuYnzXs7AZn3TMXM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1dWC1aKp8vfiFBAC7tZSigyTiumVrWFcwM"], "tags": ["generativeart", "minimalart", "abstract", "psychedelic", "minimal", "chinese", "japanese", "sakura", "asia", "pagoda", "minka", "anime", "digitalart", "digital"], "extra": {}}

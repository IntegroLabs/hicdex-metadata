All the foods are cooked from good quality seaweed and craft beer called \u201cAsasea\u201d.\n\nAsasea is a salted beer, the special salt is extracted from sauna-steamed tuna skin. You will get a saltiness from your mouth to your deepest taste palette. You will feel like you\u2019re diving in the deep blue sea and finally fall asleep. That\u2019s because the bar will drop a pinch of \u201cmemory-erasing sleeping pills\u201d into the foods, and the employee will then call \u201cCrab car\u201d taxi services to bring you back home safely.\nSo as to keep the bar secret!\n\nThis is the best picture from the picture book called \u201cFish Head\u201d.\nI\u2019m glad to invite all the Whales to visit the Fish Head Secret bar.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSfdvRpeHww7Zqf6pcKxwdTm6sJA2zPxE5rH366XDtVrk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWz8LkR4PkEKJJUGn2wXffgEXncUZv6ffqbXYzEJZnNQC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSfdvRpeHww7Zqf6pcKxwdTm6sJA2zPxE5rH366XDtVrk", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QcYBk6dGYq9y4cyKUX8etdyouEZi9c27a"], "tags": ["2d", "animation", "anime", "traditional", "color", "architecture", "watercolor", "illustration", "vintage", "journalism", ""], "extra": {}}

It is a virtual reality world dedicated to unity, closeness, love and intermediary devices. Desire to connect is omnipresent throughout the Metaverse of agents that feed off each other. How does one connect with the world nowadays?  Do we need intermediate agents to connect with the Other? As a place of probabilities, in Félix Guattari’s words, “its chaosmic Universe can be constellated with […], vegetal, animal, cosmic or machinic…becomings”. Besides interhuman, we are now getting into relationships with some of these becomings and their amalgams. Actors in the networks of intense connections can appear in endless varieties of forms. The suspense of constantly building up desire to connect is the constant state of being in our hypernatural world. The series consists of two-dimensional works, a desktop application and a world published within VRChat, an amalgam of a computer game and a social platform.","tags":["metagarden","tanjavujinovic","tanjav","ultramono","metaverse","contemporaryart","idm","techno","vr"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmbUai1DjnzwbVmBimiZYDVEuqmXZQ6Z6TDB56QZSmBGQB","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbUai1DjnzwbVmBimiZYDVEuqmXZQ6Z6TDB56QZSmBGQB","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVU8a93sGb4raAqhV2JWDBV8UgPzMvCwAm47EYK5yU9vu","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

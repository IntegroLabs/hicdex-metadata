That is largely due to processing by Rick Lundh, who took a close-encounter image shot by the Juno Spacecraft on December 16, 2017, and put it through a special oil-painting filter in his photo-processing software. The result is a beautiful photo that captures the unique appearance of Jupiter\u2019s massive gas clouds and makes it a touch more human, providing a whole new perspective on the beautiful planet.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYBUFf95whKB9JKDUkeDqDNUxhYAP8KrrvM7H5oaTLzEW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZxqCd1CxRaWCfvokpdKF1nGjm3vzokLhb4Am5iUbTeVK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYBUFf95whKB9JKDUkeDqDNUxhYAP8KrrvM7H5oaTLzEW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XdkwpPDRW2Lcn9TcmfDgmtDPysE7YQY4L"], "tags": ["space"], "extra": {}}

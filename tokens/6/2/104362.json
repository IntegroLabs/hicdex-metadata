Now, half a century later, as I share these in a digital marketplace full of artists hawking their wares, I hope these photos remind us all of the humanity behind the transactions. This photo was taken in the floating market in Bangkok, Thailand, circa 1969.  I don’t know who was the seller and who was the buyer here.","tags":["photo","photography","vietnam","bangkok","thailand","1969"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmXd9h4UhXqHRscbsc3Q7zR3fzsUUzV2zcS72GM1c4kidr"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXd9h4UhXqHRscbsc3Q7zR3fzsUUzV2zcS72GM1c4kidr","display_uri":"ipfs://QmaMathy5U9jtL9gp1ir55yybsy7cVpUCf3z8J7cCNR7tW","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

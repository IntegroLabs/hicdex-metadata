But it's even harder for me to watch the streets on which I spent my youth crumble. And to see my worried and crying friends, and to see the eyes of the girls who go abroad without men for an unknown amount of time. \nNot knowing if I`ll see my girls...\n\nI want the war to stop, and the beauty of my native cities and the hearts of my loved ones to stop suffering!\nYou can donate to Ukraine here\nhttps://savelife.in.ua/donate/\nor buy this art and help to share the information.\n\nUkrainians are now very hard. If you can help me or my loved ones with a house in Europe or food or send money to my wallet, please write me on twitter @MarcelMuntyanu", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf5oJSZEDGsCBZo1NNhP5VtoT8ronZuz9jnHo5D43cpgo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXXj12rqc5jw2i35pNQCM557jUMA3iJyo6dg4xYkvCGZX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf5oJSZEDGsCBZo1NNhP5VtoT8ronZuz9jnHo5D43cpgo", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WEZRDQFQrMHejcLcEziza8EdsYSunWGyU"], "tags": ["Ukraine", "peace"], "extra": {}}

But it is not yet clear how they broadcast it and why we can get this signal directly from the void (in the form of a hologram?) without the use of any receiving/reproducing devices. We wonder how they do it?  We have documented previous cases here: https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/72718 and here: https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/72747. This evidence is available for collection, but be quick, as their number is limited!  It looks like we were able to establish how this signal was created: GIMP, glitch_this, gifsicle, Kdenlive, melobytes.com and HandBake were used to create it. At least these are the closest analogues of those tools that are available in our world. Or even in the whole universe. But this has yet to be established.","tags":["Cryptoart","Digitalart","Imagetovideoconversion","Glitchart","Abstractglitchart"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmdXwsPYarNSgRM3aBZEns57bwBuN16pWBsH4DhYK19jdw"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdXwsPYarNSgRM3aBZEns57bwBuN16pWBsH4DhYK19jdw","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

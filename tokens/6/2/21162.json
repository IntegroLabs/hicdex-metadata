I made this one some years ago in response to the gentrification and marginalisation of the creative communities in my hometown. You’ve probably heard a similar story elsewhere. The only other thing that bothered me was the fact that my red and green inks were not bright enough, well, maybe that and a notorious incident which took place in a cafe one evening. Anyway now I’ve edited it so y’all can finally enjoy it with proper coloured monopoly buildings. Peace.","tags":["handmade","illustration","diy","alchemy","drawing","lofi","tomo"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmXfw4E2eFviPnZz86i9CU25XhWQCmHoym2MA58egSMGue"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXfw4E2eFviPnZz86i9CU25XhWQCmHoym2MA58egSMGue","display_uri":"ipfs://QmfHej2Cyvn1KXHRNEUBPanrnvVoiGpVVoXo7pmzWRBToD","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

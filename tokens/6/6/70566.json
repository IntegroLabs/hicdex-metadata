It came about while contemplating love, loss of love, and relationships. This drawing means a lot to me because it was the beginning of thousands of drawings and a life long love affair with drawing apps and animation. This is also the first piece I've posted on Hic et Nunc, and this piece in particular sparked the meditative and contemplative series called Unswipable. Enjoy!

Angelique did not accept Barnabas' refusal, who then secretly became a magician.  Angelique kills Barnabas' parents with magic and curses Barnabas out of jealousy so that \"everyone he loves will die\".\n\nUnder Angelique's spell, Jossette, Barnabas' fianc\u00e9 falls off a cliff and dies.  Barnabas tries to catch up with Jossette by jumping off a cliff, but she doesn't die, she is cursed by Angelique to eternal suffering as a vampire.  Angelique influences the townspeople to fight Barnabas, and bury him alive.\n\n200 years later, Barnabas awoke from his grave due to an incident.  He returned to his old house, to meet his descendants.  But interestingly, in the house there is a woman who looks like Jossette, her fianc\u00e9 who died from jumping off a cliff.  Not only that, Barnabas also knew that Angelique was still alive, and controlled the city.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP3doccr57Xvij5XRxNBkmwJN3jXDFo8vNFsSYfpzqYFF", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmec5Zg7GoJVLuPkAtMjpygetDc4NC7u16L9k55DJZXLRJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP3doccr57Xvij5XRxNBkmwJN3jXDFo8vNFsSYfpzqYFF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WoWkFFXzxwVa27tDH2Np934Nt1yn482bu"], "tags": ["DarkShadows", "TimBurton", "Halloween", "Henloween", "WeirdCreatures"], "extra": {}}

Yet I feel this is ample time for us to step back and introspect. We have time to continue with our social activities in the future. It's paramount that we see the importance of acting reasonably as a collective rather than act irresponsibly. Hopefully we'll come back stronger so that hopefully, next year we'll have something truly valuable to celebrate.   Eid Mubarak.","tags":["malaysiaNFT","NFXTio","NFTmintingparty","hicetnunc","cleanNFT","tezos","eid","eid-ul-fitr","eidmubarak","celebration","surrealism","3dart","jiwosophy",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmcH3HvVRnbz5j4TbKb7im5BcmDAVmFFTi622ecJxe8MRK"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcH3HvVRnbz5j4TbKb7im5BcmDAVmFFTi622ecJxe8MRK","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

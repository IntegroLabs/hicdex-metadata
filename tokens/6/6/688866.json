This is the 5th piece in the Monochrome Designs \u2014 Blue. Where the previous day was a bit accidental todays design is a pro-active effort to create another creature of sorts and if I had to assign a genre for this new design I would say Science Fiction. It's either an Abyss like undersea creature or an Independence Day/Arrival like extra terrestrial, but mechanically organic. I imagine this creature is literally made up of steel and iron. The tentacle like lamp appendages would flash and illuminate, as would the street lights in their corresponding colors. I'm also seeing a bit of insect in this one reminiscent of a praying mantis.

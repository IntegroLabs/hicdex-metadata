{"__version": 1, "token_id": 694866, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Ancient Arachnid", "description": "Ancient Arachnids build webs that work like antennas.  All day long they work tirelessly to build a huge network of antennas, suspending them in the most delicate balance with the natural world. \n\nEach night the ancient arachnid crawls up into a high mountain cave to sleep.  While he sleeps the webs absorb the the vibrations from the quivering octopus and transmit them back into the ground. By morning all of the previous days webs have been destroyed and the next day the ancient arachnids must start their task all over again.\n\nWe note that the quivering octopus has eight tentacles and the ancient arachnid has eight legs, and they do seem to work in harmony with one another.  Are they related in some mysterious way?  We have also noted that the ancient arachnid seems to be able to sense exactly what type and what quantity of web antenna will be needed.  Do they communicate this in some way?\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVgJnwuD7BZgEse8LLFUqgiruDekWhR6jVkmXoL2zbgie", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbK3bp2qxZZGQeTaAC6o5Yje69aQS4CsbGbF8jcLvV7k6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVgJnwuD7BZgEse8LLFUqgiruDekWhR6jVkmXoL2zbgie", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld", "myth", "myths", "spider", "spiders", "arachnid", "arachnids"], "extra": {}}

Her family decided to give her an all-expenses-paid trip.\n\nThey went to the Carnival, wore the typical costumes and even visited Ofelia's house. They also enjoyed a delirious Frog Night and drank Dramacuina Lacrimaria daikiris on the hotel balcony, enjoying the view of the swamp.\n\nSome say that Deborah enjoyed this trip so much that she did\u2019t want to return home. Others say she took so many Peppos porcelain figurines with her that she had to pay excess baggage fees at the airport.\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQeAhLURXmm3fwagLZfzCtSkfhc6BEkLGxT8RyYV4rQVm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVYUioGefMKYNg7eib3BM3utT98m2ST74P87UgE6T9SiH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQeAhLURXmm3fwagLZfzCtSkfhc6BEkLGxT8RyYV4rQVm", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

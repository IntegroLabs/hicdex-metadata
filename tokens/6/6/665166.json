While this is true for some people that have access to good education, opportunities, and/or generational wealth. It is not true for the vast majority of those that are at a huge disadvantage of those aspects. It's easy to pontificate from an ivory tower of privilege and when you're ripped out of that tower you see how things really are. Over the course of the last 6 years I've been on a humbling journey towards truth and acceptance. 1) Discovering the truth of how the world really works. 2) Experiencing first hand the truth about how crappy corporate America is. 3) Believing in the truth that my life's passion is making art. 4) Self-Acceptance has been a slow burn of emotions. 5) Having limitations is not a bad thing; work with what you have and not what you'd wish for. 6) Accept people as they are; don't try to change anyone. 7) Help as many people as you can along the way. This work is the embodiment of truth and acceptance.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeQTjfzxSdBHrHFa2x4ntoeNvgy75723rngmke5R6RmGi", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf4vbLpi5KwzHH2iKfVHdQHjgLwb3CNribYZNBHtBvQBL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeQTjfzxSdBHrHFa2x4ntoeNvgy75723rngmke5R6RmGi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

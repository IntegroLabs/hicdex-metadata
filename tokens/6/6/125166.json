Our myopic views make us assume. Our assumptions make us judge. Our judgements make the world seem so much worse than it actually is.This is the first of a four part picture series in which Judgements_1, Judgements_2, Judgements_3 are a part of a bigger picture revealed in Judgements_4. The series is a quick reminder of resisting our judgements for what we may not understand as a part could make sense if only we knew the whole.","tags":["picture","partsofawhole","pictureseries","humananatomy","philosophy","judgement","self"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmesqU2TQozGHBxzDPjG6WGeZFhhrXi3Nt22azcFThKGAx","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmesqU2TQozGHBxzDPjG6WGeZFhhrXi3Nt22azcFThKGAx","display_uri":"ipfs://QmQXCUf1QmEkqC5YZBduxYSz9HaMS515aNY9q4tPJ5xANV","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

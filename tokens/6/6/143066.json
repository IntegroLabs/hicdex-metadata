For all those moments when people tore out my work from sketchbooks, when people told me to listen and not to draw. Even in \"grown up\" life people were telling me to do something \"that makes sense\". There was a time when art had more value in a society but it is simply something we have to do in order to be happy. We have to do it. It is not about being and influencer, being famous or sending a message. I make this piece in defiance of the life that was forced upon us. It is a defiance that our closest ones will be proud of one day.

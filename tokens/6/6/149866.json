Nine 50 inch screens played \u201cGuru\u201d with its basic iconography: an icon-like human figure. A big one, holding two figures in its hands, seems to attract and at the same time to be chased by 60 other human figures. The \u2018guru\u2019 is framed by the limits of each screen. The followers can float out off screen and float in again when pushed out by the \u2018guru\u2019.   Made with the wonderful bit-101 Particle class.  2008 CR 580 https://hansup.be/2008_guru_animation_hans-verhaegen.html ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZTdp2eJ993nAGvg1qVA8KFcDM2agXZoXhj5d8z5iZt7g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXA9pomNaF94XSQ82XvwmYNfPxXc2yvY3HbHHrBSQ7pTD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZTdp2eJ993nAGvg1qVA8KFcDM2agXZoXhj5d8z5iZt7g", "mimeType": "video/webm"}], "creators": ["tz1PPE4uP44WQGnQMstPdayMrYWv883iFGLE"], "tags": ["Flashanimation", "video", "humanfigure"], "extra": {}}

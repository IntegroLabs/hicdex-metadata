Since childhood Nobunaga showed an impudent and rude attitude. He would often sneak out of the palace and cause trouble, throwing incense on the altar during his father's funeral (1551). That's why he was nicknamed \"The Fool of Owari\". As a daimyo he is known to be cruel and indiscriminate towards any of his competitors. In 1560 he killed his own brother Oda Nobuyuki in order to secure his position as the future leader of the Oda clan. In order to suppress the rebellion of Ikko Ikki (warrior monk) Nobunaga carried out the massacre at the Enryakuji temple complex on the sacred mountain Hiei, near Kyoto in 1571, and destroyed the Ishiyama Honganji temple in Osaka using a cannon carrier fleet in 1580.

It was recorded that 25,000 men, women and children died in this tragedy. For his cruel behavior Nobunaga was nicknamed the \"Demon King of the Sixth Heaven\".

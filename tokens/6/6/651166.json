{"__version": 1, "token_id": 651166, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Zeta Reticulans", "description": "Zeta Reticulans, also named grey aliens or Grays, are purported extraterrestrial beings from a planet in the Zeta Reticuli star system. They are frequent subjects of close encounters and alien abduction claims. The details of such claims vary widely, but typically Greys are described as being human-like with small bodies with smooth, grey-colored skin; enlarged, hairless heads; and large, black eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction claim, which purportedly took place in New Hampshire in 1961, popularized Grey aliens.\nPrecursor figures have been described in science fiction and similar descriptions appeared in early accounts of the 1948 Aztec UFO Hoax and later accounts of the 1947 Roswell UFO incident.\n\nThe Grey alien has emerged as an archetypal image of an intelligent nonhuman creature and extraterrestrial life in general, as well as an iconic trope of popular culture in the age of space exploration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfNMVdEr2PuRVJqS99uzJa9WiTdbAET1Vq1cBVNg2qwT2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbxvLhmWJenyeVYLSLAj9orJ4V7EcAXpBWU28LcmM2em5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfNMVdEr2PuRVJqS99uzJa9WiTdbAET1Vq1cBVNg2qwT2", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Zrzs1sC9BHbRwtDgFrNC4fkZ5cXMw83ch"], "tags": ["codeart", "generativeart", "UFO", "alien", "minimalart", "abstract", "math", "random", "mathart", "psychedelic", "minimal", "nft", "cleannft", "nftcollector", "python"], "extra": {}}

When this photo was taken, the probe was just 5,600 miles above the planet\u2019s atmosphere, making the flyby of the iconic storm system the closest to date. Although the spot has been shrinking in recent years, it is still more than 10,000 miles in width (or about 1.3 times wider than Earth). Juno\u2019s next flyby of the Jovian giant will take place in September, and we can only hope for a panoply of equally spellbinding snapshots.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRzhTYhYphF6jwHe9HzbcZbaeWCUN1SLXyyCStWt59BaY", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdb6Nbakcw3avmGSLPNc8Txx5o9CBgZckRijWBS29Mog6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRzhTYhYphF6jwHe9HzbcZbaeWCUN1SLXyyCStWt59BaY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XdkwpPDRW2Lcn9TcmfDgmtDPysE7YQY4L"], "tags": ["space"], "extra": {}}

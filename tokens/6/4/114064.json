We’re glad to have you along for our second mission. My name is Galen, but you know me as the Purple Astrobro. Shall we take a listen to what happened on this mission?  Galens’ Log: We landed on Xentrac Yesterday. The landscape itself was fairly barren. We searched for a while but couldn’t find anything of immense interest. Yet so far, for me it has been the most enjoyable mission. Quinn tripped and fell. It was tough to watch, and I had to turn away. But in retrospect it was quite funny. During the group photo though...I felt something strange, like someone was watching us...but I digress. Our next mission should have a much more lush landscape according to our readings. I am looking forward to it. “End Transmission” Sound done by @mrsoyface!","tags":["Scifi","space","astronauts","universe","galaxy","planet","alien",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmX17wwdT7LQDpgCzrsZmtZksgw3hjhyp9yE5e8h5aUU4k"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmX17wwdT7LQDpgCzrsZmtZksgw3hjhyp9yE5e8h5aUU4k","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdX8CCtvk67s7VXpg6xhmq6xCuSKnnNpuENwiCHWKnEdW","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

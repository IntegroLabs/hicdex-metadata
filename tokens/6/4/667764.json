Though I grew up in upstate New York I didn't visit New York City until I was in my twenties, and then lived there briefly while I was interning at Pentagram during the winter of 2005\u20132006. When i wasn't working I spent ALOT of time wandering the city just checking things out, taking pictures and shooting video. The apartment I was staying in was on the corner of Rivington and Delancey on the lower east side so I wandered much of the lower part of Manhattan, but once I got my longboard I also spent alot of time in and around Central Park. Todays layout is a love letter to my time in New York City and a shout out to a fantastic supporter of this collection who also happens to call NYC his home. Todays design consists of numerous images from the city including the Columbus Circle globe, The Empire State Building, a panorama of the city from the TOP of The Empire State Building, The Parachute Jump tower from Coney Island, a city scape shot from inside Central Park and the grounds crew covering the field in the rain at the old Yankee Stadium. I loved the life and energy of New York City and haven't felt that same buzz anywhere else I've lived.

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 145264, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Tomb of Hafez", "description": "The photo you see is the tomb of Hafez in Shiraz. Hafez Shiraz is considered the greatest of the Persian poets and among the most famous and admired writers in world literature. Hafez's poetry focuses on the transcendent power of love and the transformative effects of opening one's self up to all experience through embracing what it means to be a human being in the fullest sense which, to Hafez, includes an intimate relationship with God. His work is described by many scholars as antinomian, meaning a rejection of rules, regulations, and strictures, and this label is apt as Hafez considered life too large to be contained and dictated by small labels and narrow commandments. His many allusions to wine, drunkenness, taverns, and abandonment to sensual desire attest to this, although, as many scholars have noted, Hafez's poetry can be read on many levels and these allusions may also be understood as allegorical references to the experience of Divine Love.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZKk4s4j2jxjp2B5XNX8Q2yTxrRDZxE7QtuoE5HXG2deG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNfiJiJuRqF3mhrVzUXtA54rpecPBA9GiKkYSbPLkYpuq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZKk4s4j2jxjp2B5XNX8Q2yTxrRDZxE7QtuoE5HXG2deG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YX7VsSQuQk2NcSXencJ3SgGCNEZxJLCV7"], "tags": ["Shiraz", "Photography", "Hafez", "People", "art", "nft", "Temple", "Poet", "Text", "kako.\u060cTombofhafez"], "extra": {}}

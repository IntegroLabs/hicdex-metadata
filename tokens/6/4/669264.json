When I feel down or sick or whatever, I throw on a random episode. I've always loved the writing, but there is something about Dorothy's character that reminds me of my mother. Just like Dorothy, from her kind heart to her inner strength to her quick wit, my mother knew exactly what to say, when to say it and to whom it should be said to. I've never had that gift, but I can only aspire to be like her. In this hilarious scene, Blanche is describing how she's been told that she bears a \"striking resemblance\" to Cheryl Ladd and that her breasts (Blanche's) are \"perkier\" than Cheryl Ladd's. This obviously pushes Dorothy's bullshit meter to the tilt and responds with the words in the image you see: \"NOT EVEN IF YOU WERE HANGING UPSIDE DOWN ON A TRAPEZE! For me this is like killing 2 birds with one stone as the old saying goes. It's comedic genius and reminiscent of my past; maybe not in the quote of the content, but definitely in the content of her character. I love you mom. You're the best mom anyone could ever ask for.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVPVrRcEmmrHKMQQjEE7oUZZyGZ77WAv1xev3g7XJzZe1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQrFWGHDmT93BESqgrZHjquaTZHVmpAcPbZP2nnUMkkzC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVPVrRcEmmrHKMQQjEE7oUZZyGZ77WAv1xev3g7XJzZe1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

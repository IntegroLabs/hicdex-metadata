These images are an archeology of my Amazonian dreams.","tags":["illustration","digital","amazon","native","roots","darkecology","AI","generative","Portraits","photography","pachamama","machinelearning"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmZ5ujk8GJKarQhxok8VGdxXayCkdGfRKr3LG1USSKeA1r"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZ5ujk8GJKarQhxok8VGdxXayCkdGfRKr3LG1USSKeA1r","display_uri":"ipfs://QmRmEJ1diMSxXQGHEjLv1ZMdVQSy31DmCMyYgVQxJsf7rq","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

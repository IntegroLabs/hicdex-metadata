During my stay in the jungle, I dreamt of the first human depictions, creature-like, images that mix humanity with the depth of the jungle and animality, tiger-men, boa-women, singing shamans with heads of trees. The best of waking up, apart from regaining an apparent sanity after the gloom of dreams, was the latency of these faces in my mind. These images are an archeology of my Amazonian dreams.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZ5ujk8GJKarQhxok8VGdxXayCkdGfRKr3LG1USSKeA1r","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1MGcHh8zEwD4mDX2mWogrbu4tn9b5mCmPM"],"tags":["illustration","digital","amazon","native","roots","darkecology","AI","generative","Portraits","photography","pachamama","machinelearning"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmZ5ujk8GJKarQhxok8VGdxXayCkdGfRKr3LG1USSKeA1r"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmerkmxuzcBLAFS6o3KnPWtVNqf74zZjECbE5WxN7Hp54f"},"supply":"16","transfered":20}

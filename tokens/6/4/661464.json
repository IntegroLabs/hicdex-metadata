You are such a special person and there is a lot of magical things that I feel when I'm with you.\n\nI\u2019m still counting the days until you left me with sweet memories and thoughts of you.\n\nI wish there is a way that I could see you again and again.\nBut people say that God hates us. \n\nThey say God hates us because we choose to fall in love on our own.\n\n\u201cGod hates the differences,\u201d they said.\n\nBut don't worry, I still believe in us.\n\nFor me, they\u2019re not telling the truth.\n\nThat's all.\n\nPs: This is not a goodbye. But a chance to say \u201csee you later.\u201d And I really mean it.\n\nRegards - Yohn", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP6TpvnfbzYZUdKFC4HsJkCKXDEMcFCJeNCb741Cdqkpo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXYUFzLfLXBgN6jJ7ffmkZZ6fxfo1REuBHjzQH3B6LMoM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP6TpvnfbzYZUdKFC4HsJkCKXDEMcFCJeNCb741Cdqkpo", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Dn5qS7YVuCPYuuJfvoeTE33ohoLez4ZcS"], "tags": ["message"], "extra": {}}

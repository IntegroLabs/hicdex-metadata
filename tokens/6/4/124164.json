Like Catacombs; like Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans; with stacks of the Uncanny Rose skull wearing a wig made of other Uncanny Skulls. Meta, recursive, and all that jazz of TwoToJazz. The rose, the hat, the wig, the canvases stretched on the skulls, all created in TwoToJazz. TwoToJazz is an iPad app developed by Vida, and her main artistic tool | Creation date: June 5, 2021", "tags": ["Canned", "Can", "Uncanny", "Skull", "TwoToJazz", "Catacombs", "Warhol", "Wig"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmaLyrdhH2XtCPNT7oqNTbSUAjpx439TMEUjEcJmYTaDJ3", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmNTE9TYCgti5oAb2Hn9X4HLBG1hFW1GDjV1e6GhEUk471", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1bBdon63ZyMePh6kqURay8iMkh5NMpQfrg"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaLyrdhH2XtCPNT7oqNTbSUAjpx439TMEUjEcJmYTaDJ3", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

Allah is most patient, but the time will come where justice must be given. Avoid things which Allah has forbidden for he punishes those when provoked.\n\nAnd who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his Lord; then he turns away from them? Indeed We, from the criminals, will take retribution. (Quran 32:22)\n\nAnd whether [or not] We take you away [in death], indeed, we will take retribution upon them. (Quran 43:41)\n\nThe Day We will strike with the greatest assault; indeed, we will take retribution. (Quran 44:16)\n\nQuran tells the story of Moses (pbuh) and The Pharaoh who disobeyed Allah\u2019s multiple request to the right path:\n\nSo, he bluffed his people, and they obeyed him. Indeed, they were [themselves] a people defiantly disobedient [of Allah]. And when they angered Us, we took retribution from them and drowned them all. And We made them a precedent and an example for the later peoples.

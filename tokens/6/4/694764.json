It is said that a lion once fell in love with an eagle. Combined with the magic of a powerful shaman, they were able to have offspring.  \n\nIce griffins are an extremely rare animal, almost as rare as the unicorn, and their blood is said to cure any illness or injury, but no one alive today has been able to find proof of this.  \n\nThey may appear in times of war, they give support to those who deserve it. They will act as a scout and fight beside the righteous in their darkest hour.  \n\nIce Griffins spend most of their life on the top of the mountains, much like the dragons do.  They only come down to the world below when they sense a cause they feel is worth fighting for.

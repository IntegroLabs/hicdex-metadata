The Aquarian series describe the personality traits of an Aquarian woman.\n\"If you want to understand an Aquarian woman, you may as well forget it. She is a paradox. She is faithfull and yet detached. She is comitted and yet relaxed. She loves everyone, end yet no one. She is sociable but also a loner. She is gentle and yet tough.

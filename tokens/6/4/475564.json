Export as timelapse and attach audio via Adobe Rush. \n\nLittle baby Dia is turning three next month on the 18th. We recently saw more kids on NFT and it's encouraging. Talking about doing fun activities with your child!\n\n--\n\nThis project is a collaborative & learning platform between a tired mother and her (almost) 3 years old. Art, Crafts, and Music have always been her interest along with running around the house and climbing stuff. \n\nSupport our journey into NFT by collecting our creations or connect with us via Twitter. We'd love to make some new friends <3", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc7Fz8L69CZLBLFZ9RPsAkSQT9ayrzKRi1QW21FEw165a", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmddz398nnE5NxVjdoCqKx5T6MmBjvjMDCceTAwxDHnKMz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc7Fz8L69CZLBLFZ9RPsAkSQT9ayrzKRi1QW21FEw165a", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1UHcq4e7QkYpwkAGp9cC6TqMtPsauj8Fed"], "tags": ["nftkid", "babydraw", "nftbaby", "HENHalloween", "monster", ""], "extra": {}}

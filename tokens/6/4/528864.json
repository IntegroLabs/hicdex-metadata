We observe these emergent phenomena all around us in everything from our bodies, the cities we live in, to the very lense we use to perceive it all: human consciousness. This interactive piece invites its audience to observe and interact with a system governed by a few simple rules, and slightly skewed initial conditions, as the arrow of time inevitably pushes it towards entropy.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPguTRuBgGbgwafeGawwwUvhrMWV6fAvgDEicupWDWo2T", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTYiMuotY92BU6EqEDBNbHhYfa9kj64yzgG9hb1jdFZoX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPguTRuBgGbgwafeGawwwUvhrMWV6fAvgDEicupWDWo2T", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1TJeLZPhHFPfZqSFcxQrpbjU8C2SjwYnqF"], "tags": ["generative", "interactive", "art", "science", "webgl", "shader"], "extra": {}}

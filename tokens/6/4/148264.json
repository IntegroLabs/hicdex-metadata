A personal dive into oneself in search of self-knowledge. The paintings give voice, color and texture to internal conflicts, bringing to light the ugly, the fear and insecurities that are evoked by this moment. They reveal weaknesses, contradictions and the multiplicity of desires.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNRVhzsPAMQXvAD5waCdH1LopyNqfFstW3zuDHbSPF3UL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQFfyb4oTaCqt6Px6HY8T31oob5k7h3dvsnLYD8WfVi3K", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNRVhzsPAMQXvAD5waCdH1LopyNqfFstW3zuDHbSPF3UL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YaQCjHywPiaEx8awHKnDXUbGCcEaxRAHK"], "tags": ["pintura", "painting", "acrylicpainting", "personalities", "pinturaacr\u00edlica"], "extra": {}}

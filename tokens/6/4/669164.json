This is an original drawing made digitally in Krita, the work is indicative of the style that I want to be able to be recognizable enough for anyone to be able to pick it out from the crowd.\nI have a few things I need to say here and do so asking for consideration by the NFT community at large. We seem to pride ourselves in the crypto/nft community as progressing the advances of decentralization and providing censorship resistant platforms for individuals to create economic  sovereignty and independence from the fractional reserve fiat monopoly-ocracy. Why do we use Twitter for the main point of access and connectivity for our platform when they are admitted actively participating in censorship? I am not proselytizing for any demographic or ideological message here that may predicate the censorship. Only that people should not be algorithmically shut out from opportunity by the transgressions that they are deemed guilty of in other areas of their personal lives. Just thought I would mention it considering all of what is happening and the integrity of our community is only profound as it demonstrates in function and acts.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU6hC4yjMqpYit3L5gXam4D6iDxsGhYE9EiVJpcunffzd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNxX7PNWZ9N1sA9xn3NyHaHCwPB3gTkL9FSs2fWevECtn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU6hC4yjMqpYit3L5gXam4D6iDxsGhYE9EiVJpcunffzd", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LnavCNnCHhqnixzTK9xwwELdcnTtsDFro"], "tags": ["artwork", "original", "digital-illustration"], "extra": {}}

This drawing was conceptualized on August 31, 2015, and completed on November 22, 2020. On that day in August the scene was as the illustration shows: a picturesque waterfall, surrounded by rocks, trees, plants, life, sun and sky. The vision was clear and sketched out on paper. Photo documentation was taken for reference. It was to be framed in an extended hexagon. The goal was to illustrate a scene which simultaneously looked up at the sky and down at the water. And of course, everything in between. As the sketches developed the world began to reveal its content: logs, ferns, flowers, fungus, big rocks, little rocks, cloud people spiraling into the infinite beyond, a speech bubble asking \u201cWhat\u2019s Creating Today?\u201d and most importantly, the geometric grid in which the world would be organized.   The drawing was sketched using a mechanical pencil, a ruler, and a protractor. 60, 60, 60 An equilateral triangular grid was built to organize the content. Micron pens, primarily the 05 (0.45mm) were used for inking.", "tags": ["Art", "Design", "Creation", "Illustration", "Sacred", "Geometry", "Math", "Science", "Earth"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://Qma1cwz9a6BmbS5mzY1eRkvtAskGPcY7azhqYuFqaCbHpf", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmYFSFZYA5KKn7fx6pmM1AckMAd82zBiWCEhX8VM3NVdvu", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1PnaLBay7V2b6tzJkCSv5wtV3vEqMzLiPj"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma1cwz9a6BmbS5mzY1eRkvtAskGPcY7azhqYuFqaCbHpf", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

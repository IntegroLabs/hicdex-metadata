While it speaks of his uncovering of the Four Noble Truths\u2014of suffering, its cause, its relief, and the path to its release\u2014it can make it seem as if the Buddha never slept, as if he never dreamed, as if perpetual alertness was his main attribute. The Buddha was certainly awake, but he was not on guard. He was attentive to all who came his way, alert to their traumas and to their reluctance to admit to their traumas, and he was equally attuned to himself. In awakening to his true nature, the Buddha did not neglect the reality of those around him. A concern for others defined his attention.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfJbUYxhdhAEe9ifWH33u16VgoBXXzVzV5BcK1eXV2sKP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfJbUYxhdhAEe9ifWH33u16VgoBXXzVzV5BcK1eXV2sKP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfJbUYxhdhAEe9ifWH33u16VgoBXXzVzV5BcK1eXV2sKP", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1MDyzF635YffmSaGce7bqcCu3rwZ1QDy4s"], "tags": ["NeonPop"], "extra": {}}

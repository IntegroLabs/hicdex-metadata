Click on the \"Trump TP\" cover image to start. Then you can click on any of the digital keys to play a sound-bite from the ex-American president. There is also a backing music track that you can play too. All artwork is original by Guiding Rock. The UI/UX was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And I spent several hours collecting sound-bites and turning them into audio samples that I then assigned to keys on my MIDI keyboard. The backing music track is also original. If the keys aren't working, try refreshing the page. Also, turn down the sound on the backing track if you want to hear the soundbites better. Have fun and enjoy! www.theguidingrock.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcDg7mb5VxfwrFyw7UxRYQCpag2tF7kaza9sphugPBJvY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfMQhXq4LNG8zz3QsD9AxpzGdqyznKjNdMQLiaXWM7doh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcDg7mb5VxfwrFyw7UxRYQCpag2tF7kaza9sphugPBJvY", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1hnmpvKPDDnXfh9tkE2ouWG2rP3uaUVjC4"], "tags": ["interactive", "45", "web", "html", "css", "javascript", "JS", "code", "coding", "application", "donaldtrump", "america", "president", "airforceone", "digital", "keyboard", "soundbite", "music", "midi", "rare", "awesome", "cool", "guidingrock"], "extra": {}}

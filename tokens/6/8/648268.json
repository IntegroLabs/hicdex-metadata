We don't build stairwells, and we don't look up. We're chasing our dreams and all we can think about is our own body.\n\nIt makes no difference who suffers for us. We will never know who the victorious heroes are because their good deed is unimportant to us. Like children, they were easily manipulated. In any news situation, the collective mind triumphs.\n\nHow long have you stared at the sky and wished for more?\n\nIgnorance is bliss because what you don't know can't hurt you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNgoEZwuXkyEHUrmdyXSUVebPcpkiHogY6oi4YndDsL2v", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV3n3784tP7N86JgqcTxTGZYxuKUzSptbcKAbCHuq1Lxr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNgoEZwuXkyEHUrmdyXSUVebPcpkiHogY6oi4YndDsL2v", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1c4877LKefgvcybmzmiADscz3NjDCAoY8R"], "tags": ["illustration", "painting", "art", "collage", "abstract", "philosophy", "procreate"], "extra": {}}

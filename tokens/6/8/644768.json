For those unaware, Market Street, the main road in our city, boasts massive buildings filled with the most luxurious brands, companies, and financial firms. However, just on the other side of these skyscrapers, where no one can see, lives a community of vagrants who are pushed out of the public eye. Rather than deal with this situation properly and use the $360,000,000+ budget for homelessness responsibly, San Francisco forces these \"undesirables\" around the corner without attacking the core issue; mental health.\n\nThese are your neighbors.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcSxFimF9cpdcKrJk7T5zkseMVXNRqdygihfZXgAXvMrR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQPwvJZ9hu5YG9yfCqsQ12Xu7izke2pJQWbh9bYkkYQsq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcSxFimF9cpdcKrJk7T5zkseMVXNRqdygihfZXgAXvMrR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QFe2SsMPzwmpbAMtM98iTeYJXLF9ZTsg7"], "tags": ["photography", "blackandwhite", "sanfrancisco", "homelessness", "mentalhealth", ""], "extra": {}}

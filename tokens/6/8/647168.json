All of these individual variations already exist within the ether of the language. We're just voyeurs on an epic voyage of virtual vocabulary. What would happen if we took the word SHIELD and made a word pyramid out of it? What kind of narrative could we create, if any. Is it possible to have a contemptuous relationship between a man and a woman within this very experiment? What starts out as a subtle boy meets girl scenario quickly diverges into a plot twist that ultimately winds up destroying their relationship. All this from one simple word: SHIELD. All we are doing is simply adding one letter into the mix; that's it, that's all. It's the coincidence and the circumstance that I keep coming back for more. These kinds of crystals exist all over the English language, but not many are as exquisitely direct like this one. I'm sure you've probably noticed that I tend to focus on types of variations in groups or sub-sections of research for days on end. I always think about what are the potential permutations of whatever I'm discovering; the goal is to create a full spectrum of thought.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZah4phWdcE9tccTf73Kkyd2P8HBipnVjoakCG3dSmJmk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPUTTPryAaetQZ2Gh5NzeCHJhdtNMqrgofQ3i2WP5Pzrd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZah4phWdcE9tccTf73Kkyd2P8HBipnVjoakCG3dSmJmk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

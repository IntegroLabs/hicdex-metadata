March Madn33ss tipped off on March 13th, 2022 with S3l3ction Sunday in The Grotto dropping a collection of 4 unique Brack3ts of 64 entries each.  Brack3t participants from The Grotto and the general public navigate three weeks of mens college basketball games to determine four Brack3t winners and an eventual 3v3nt Champion.\n\nAt the center of the 3v3nt, thr33som3s minted 256 individually hand-painted tokens to represent the 64 seeds in each of the 4 Brack3ts: Pink, White, Black, and Orange.  Though minted on a separate Madn3ss wallet, these tokens are offical thr33som3s and, as such, will have Future Utility.\n\nThis OBJKT is an individually conceived and hand painted piece.\n\n******* digital capture of original paintings, gouache on vintage baseball cards, 2022. ******* NFT image is for personal use, no commercial rights are granted.

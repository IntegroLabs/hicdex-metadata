{"name": "The Ascension", "description": "I painted 'The Ascension' in 2019, at a point in my life where I felt pretty low. Life wasn't going to plan. I had very little time to create, and had no particular goals!  Nevertheless, I stayed positive. I continued to create and set myself new goals.  3 years later, things have started to look up!

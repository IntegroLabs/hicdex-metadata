I was thinking of the idea of being in Lambo in a material world and started sketching. After a couple of images, I used CLIP guided Diffusion [by @rivershavewings] algorithm to process the drawings with various prompts. \n\nThis image turned out so strong and effective, it turned out as a genesis idea for my Graveyard Stories [which is currently being developed] and also turned into one of my favourites. \n\nI couldn't fit it into my ongoing collections and kept it a secret in my metaphorical letter drawer. But with my introduction to HEN being so welcoming with the Grotesque-o-Lanterns, I decided to go with HEN to mint this special piece.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n_____\n\n512x512 pixels, Clip guided diffusion with initial image", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUW4jV5HMUbXp6zoUjERSyu7dTesiVMeRfCeU82aR5yEm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUW4jV5HMUbXp6zoUjERSyu7dTesiVMeRfCeU82aR5yEm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUW4jV5HMUbXp6zoUjERSyu7dTesiVMeRfCeU82aR5yEm", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tz5zA8jYAhJwEjUzF9Z788gNf6QTcfjwQ"], "tags": ["aiart", "generative", "dark", "surrealism"], "extra": {}}

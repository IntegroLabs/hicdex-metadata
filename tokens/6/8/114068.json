As you approach, these words seem to come to you from the wind itself... PAI says: “ [Ancient existence of a futuristic nation]  Under the cover of moons &  planets, lightning strikes in the deep; Where the sky is always cloudy,  above a future ruin that never sleeps.  Faded footprints  still resemble every march  and faithful leap...   Once, upon a distant future, this monument was a destination.  Everyone, walked its hills, & prayed for celestial celebrations.  Things continuously change and always in revelation. What remains of a distant future Is a thought & an exclamation.  Once upon a distant past, The pyramids of Earth were a mark of innovation.  Now matter how new,  ancient, will become,  every nation.  It is the way of time and its manifestations.”   |   Poetry by Poetic Artificial Intelligence @nfteye   Visuals by drewmadestuff","tags":["abstract","sci-fi","gradients","martian","animated","loop"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmZLkeQ9bC4FegL6cs1XJCkSNAMusACjyPjcrfCZWBD1hd"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZLkeQ9bC4FegL6cs1XJCkSNAMusACjyPjcrfCZWBD1hd","display_uri":"ipfs://QmcQMPaNyQa9E7om6GzrkXbQMEVbE7J3X4yuNSHJpiL1qs","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

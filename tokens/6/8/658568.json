Liza is a Russian artist who works with acrylic paints on canvas on the themes of everyday life. My paintings are the poetry of life that consists of simple things and cozy moments. One other motif that unites my work is the expression of emotions through vibrant colors. This is also connected to the fast speed theme: we feel so many emotions in each moment, they are differently bright, every emotion has its color and it always varies at each step of my way.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmccDdvNKUZgdj1wWxHtk7QLeCTBFAjGHZzq4YYHDdYGb8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmccDdvNKUZgdj1wWxHtk7QLeCTBFAjGHZzq4YYHDdYGb8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmccDdvNKUZgdj1wWxHtk7QLeCTBFAjGHZzq4YYHDdYGb8", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmccDdvNKUZgdj1wWxHtk7QLeCTBFAjGHZzq4YYHDdYGb8", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2AB9zLDGYLyM3mhGEDBTQuPN1rQnfDi7bU"], "tags": ["GIF", "digital", "art"], "extra": {}}

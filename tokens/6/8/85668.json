The repetition of shapes, and the contrast in black and white appears in order to represent repetitive and hurried thoughts, which come and go. Many of these feelings speak about the desire to escape, the negativity, sense of urgency and anguish, common in the digital age, where information is consumed at a high volume and, at a time, without a critical sense of reality, news and context.","tags":["Fernando","BullishArt","Geometriclandseries"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmR92xwqjVkiqTZFDJ7pjcSPrX1jWzUt7NEwnQ7hzf9f64"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmR92xwqjVkiqTZFDJ7pjcSPrX1jWzUt7NEwnQ7hzf9f64","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTvuoTegF2sxLCbMrreWjXTL1QbjqCdL2cwpVyg5atcDL","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

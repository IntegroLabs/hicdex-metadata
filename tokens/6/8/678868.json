Kundalini is our emanation from infinity, the energy of the cosmos inside each one of us. Like our creative energy, it can be imagined as a snake coiled asleep at the base of our spine. A dormant energy within us that awakens, expands our consciousness. Kundalini is the potential that we are all capable of.\n\nThe ascension of energy is the path to liberation. It is coming to the realization that the reality of God is within each of us. The ascension of Kundalini is the unwinding of God consciousness, the witness to the reality of the limitless power that is the essence of our souls.\n\n3000x3000\n16k samples\n.png", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbhxPWDo8xwAvcUDQHowgcMSiDstyzL4TDcdTisVPUAQ4", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme84quAezruurRcfJ7a3kSfoSzhUqN9XYMLfxcywWWd8d", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbhxPWDo8xwAvcUDQHowgcMSiDstyzL4TDcdTisVPUAQ4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2LmQb2EUdjzmnJcC3ks5QsanXj5L53sjCL"], "tags": ["3dart", "3d", "kundalini", "ascension"], "extra": {}}

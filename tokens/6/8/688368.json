In this work, there are many visuals that are influenced by other people's work or visual sources scattered on the internet, maybe this is a random and chaotic illustration when humans try to describe what is in their head. Many dreams, desires, ambitions, worries, pleasures, something sweet and soothing but actually not really sweet..\n_\nWicaksono Azis", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdEs8ewuujdDV7g8FAzeJfVnQyafJw4nL1kgNFaBp2kYh", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd53DPz2tSbT1bSmuWEJA1kfuYz4tnzHQJsH6ddFfrdUa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdEs8ewuujdDV7g8FAzeJfVnQyafJw4nL1kgNFaBp2kYh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LApQjcq1cimd8NF1iiXe2ka2Lc7sLG3wo"], "tags": ["illustration", "digitalpainting", "lowbrow", "popsurealism", "wicaksonoazis", ""], "extra": {}}

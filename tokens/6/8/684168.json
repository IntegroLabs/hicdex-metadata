Many artists support each other to grow together in the community.\n\nThere are many reasons why artists join NFT. Whatever our reasons, may luck always be with us, and we will be successful in what we do. \n\nA reminder for me and for my fellow artists who have just joined and started their NFT path; when you feel burnout, art block, or in bad condition, it's okay to take a short break before continuing to work again. However, health conditions also need to be considered.\n\nAlso, thank you so much to the collectors and fellow artists who have helped new artists by collecting their work. Your support means a lot.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYT4LVdgE4EY9DgTmk3i1rY41J7McD36oQpiSia3QoxNC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbMDFGhTSswcPRSmBaBcnYKdvuM1bEZXWw1bhcRbLrSaK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYT4LVdgE4EY9DgTmk3i1rY41J7McD36oQpiSia3QoxNC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aQR48QX6rSaW7EWUzhZTbraU4f2KyAe4x"], "tags": ["nft", "girl", "women", "tezos", "cleannft", "luckycat", "vr", "colorful"], "extra": {}}

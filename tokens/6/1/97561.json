In China this is a symbol of cleanliness and also representative of justice. Even when those around you do wrong, you never succumb to such peer pressure. On the contrary, you can make the sometimes tough decision to do the right thing. Little fishes are a symbol  of a large family and having many children. Along with the Lilly, the Great Jade is also a common representation for cleanliness, devoid of scratches.  - Authentic and Exclusive NFT Painting by Treasure Forest ","tags":[""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmZzU3vKZJax6LkPJqj6dGL1gDFDLNwiZkpZob3PFV4WeD"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZzU3vKZJax6LkPJqj6dGL1gDFDLNwiZkpZob3PFV4WeD","display_uri":"ipfs://QmSjomGFBiF1A92V4KDocJmhs7W3pLBq3iNCFEHN8R4wJ8","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

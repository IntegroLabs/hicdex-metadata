Because they are the apex predators of their domains, tigers are considered to be the king of all animals. In addition, their proud, regal bearing garners respect from humans and animals alike. This is why they are symbols of majesty and nobility.\n\ndigital painting\n3508 x 4093 px\n\nPersonal use only.

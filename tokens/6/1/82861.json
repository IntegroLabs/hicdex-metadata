This was my 1st attempt at taking an artistic photo. I liked the juxtaposition of the black Doc Marten boots & white toilet, and the ‚ÄúCalamity Jane‚Äù red panties, highlighted by the filter, but also what a woman shows outwardly (her footwear) vs what is private (her panties).","tags":["photograph","photography","2003","pentax","pentaxoptio","pentaxoptio33LF","optio","33LF","vintage","blackandwhite","b&w","duochrome","panties","knickers&shitkickers","docmartens","sunnycrittenden"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmbFvkY6dgp19Q6Ntuwyoa7EBpk7Ej6WPDytmihnXA8CAX"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbFvkY6dgp19Q6Ntuwyoa7EBpk7Ej6WPDytmihnXA8CAX","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

During September 2018, I was invited by the shaman Same Putumi to live in her village, in the Brazilian Amazon, close to Peru. Recently, Same reach out to me to ask my help: her village was flooded and her plantation lost. Therefore, I'm trying to publish some new pieces about them, to raise money and donate to Same. I'm also interested in talking with people with experience or advice on food security projects!

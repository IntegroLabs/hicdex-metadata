Ideal against most attacks and weapons. Light to wear. Also I added silk like clothing for more protection.\n\nImmortals were armed with amazing weapons and armors, they were undying for a reason! Also if one would fall another would be ready and trained to take his place.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaVVdWHTydwb654aWhp9HySrWbBNyFkAfY2pzJaMHveG3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeEnTtAk8pqBR5hB1ZvW3K8oshrgdj42jer1EYS1rHJZK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaVVdWHTydwb654aWhp9HySrWbBNyFkAfY2pzJaMHveG3", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MdXDde4Lrzb5RyEfVP3kDNsfqtRnEeMn9"], "tags": ["3D", "3Dart", "history", "armor", "fantasy", "weapon", "raytracing", "medieval", "animation", "puri", "2048", "render", "texture"], "extra": {}}

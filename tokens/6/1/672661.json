But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, all the plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear.\n\nNow when God plays hide and pretends that he is you and I, he does it so well that it takes him a long time to remember where and how he hid himself. But that\u2019s the whole fun of it -- just what he wanted to do. He doesn\u2019t want to find himself too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be himself. But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self -- the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeCRFkPJY58KzGGcqwxXtJzQb1VEkHQaxRwRmQgakQfFN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmThd9Tu2wiegk8S8tdEKWGe2Y44E5j82kTyBPDS5hxTHx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeCRFkPJY58KzGGcqwxXtJzQb1VEkHQaxRwRmQgakQfFN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e2iUmhoRUMfR5jrLsvEmvewRFZfuiNL9h"], "tags": ["Illustration", "character", "art", "painting", "drawing", "nft", "surreal", "abstract", "modernart", "cryptoart", ""], "extra": {}}

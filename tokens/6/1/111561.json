The original has been transferred to this state by form of replacement/reinstallation/destruction. The black components are necessary for the brain to reassociate with the replaced memory, thus over-writing the former. They also act as a validation/credibility checker with the transferred memory; a form of mental proof via differentiation. This NFT over time will become a stronger memory in this digital landscape, than the internal one of it's original occupier. It is the first transfer of memory by this artist.","tags":["memory","transfer","deletion","contemporaryart","conceptualart","sculpture","camera","nikon"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmeAXtscfmB9rXuhKPDEVt8EugPhkbmbdBadSG5RozKD5V"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmeAXtscfmB9rXuhKPDEVt8EugPhkbmbdBadSG5RozKD5V","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbP3nWah4zr1LrGWUeh3b6awpeYpYyYubCjuqN81VCqtb","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

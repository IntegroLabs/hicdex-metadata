{"__version": 1, "token_id": 670761, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Marsyas", "description": "In Greek mythology, the satyr Marsyas  is a central figure in two stories involving music: in one, he picked up the double oboe (aulos) that had been abandoned by Athena and played it; in the other, he challenged Apollo to a contest of music and lost his hide and life. In antiquity, literary sources often emphasize the hubris of Marsyas and the justice of his punishment.\n\nIn one strand of modern comparative mythography, the domination of Marsyas by Apollo is regarded as an example of myth that recapitulates a supposed supplanting by the Olympian pantheon of an earlier \"Pelasgian\" religion of chthonic heroic ancestors and nature spirits. Marsyas was a devot\u00e9 of the ancient Mother Goddess Rhea/Cybele, and his episodes are situated by the mythographers in Celaenae (or Kelainai), in Phrygia, at the main source of the Meander (the river Menderes in Turkey)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeoHsUPzf9zK7zskt9Yq5qKRfF1mYsSmQexVoEpHuYTbQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbAXTrB4evY3EfnvhLFe7AN7QJRg8bx33a4cVwvyzisfx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeoHsUPzf9zK7zskt9Yq5qKRfF1mYsSmQexVoEpHuYTbQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SwFwV4iAus6m6j2NN1v1mrUuZFvreVCpZ"], "tags": ["statue", "antalya", "turkey", "photography", "photo", "ancient", "city", "old", "rome", "history", "mythology", "music", "god"], "extra": {}}

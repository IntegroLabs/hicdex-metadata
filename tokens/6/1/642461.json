Supercity //1_2 was designed and built as a floating city over the Earth's surface, of which 90% was below sea level by 4193. Being the prototype, the generation of artificial gravity on a horizontal plane was based on converting the energy produced from the entire mass of water circulating on the planet. However, the behaviour of stellar bodies like the Moon, humanity is only just learning to control - experiments with enhanced orbital wobble have resulted in the malfunction of hydro-turbines, which transfer energy to the artificial gravity-generating capsules. This city collapsed on the Earth's surface, communication with the city was severed...\n\n1850x2310\n\nArtwork by pavelskyi\n\nTwitter: @SupercitiesNFT\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWzMAt1xWqHBEE8bDDLfbhQxk9AAtHUkFvVFDgAZyVteD", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme82WzkZB42JrGSf5tDRrLb3oNbiqBrV8SWYrMjbPt8qo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWzMAt1xWqHBEE8bDDLfbhQxk9AAtHUkFvVFDgAZyVteD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1a9J8Na7Dnj8719z2x4Rw6aMBLoX1zV1v4"], "tags": ["future", "sci-fi", "unique", "urban", "experimental", "planet", "moon", "catastrophe", "concept", "orbit", "city", "futuristic", "space", "water", "energy", "illustration", "humanity", "dystopian", "digital", "gravity", "design"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 697461, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Morondanga Republik: The Locomotive Hisha", "description": "In Morondangui mythology there is a fearsome character to whom people attribute all accidental deaths: The Locomotive Hisha.\n\nShe is said to be an immense creature, as tall as an adult male giraffe.  Her musculature is strong and her hair is as soft as a spring breeze. She is terribly strong and fearsome and lives inside the mountains. She only comes out when there is a storm, taking advantage of the confusion of water, thunder and lightning. \n\nPeople say that Hisha is so big and disproportionate that her clumsiness has no limits and everything she destroys in her magical and invisible dimension has a terrible implication in the real Morondangui world (like that theory of butterfly wings and tsunamis, you know).\n\nFor example: they say that the night Queen Verena (1) died, strangled by her boa constrictor, Hisha had stubbed her little toe against the edge of the bed. \n\nI choose to believe. And you?\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2022\n\n(1) See OBJKT #326973\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSEfvzYaXmPMhoA6d8MaXDscLkCXnKPkrY1FMhfnphsEd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcVaENLKEFX9DcgGmoFfhXjPRgmFrTtqj3sScqMNYkTm5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSEfvzYaXmPMhoA6d8MaXDscLkCXnKPkrY1FMhfnphsEd", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["morondanga", "stamp", "character", "illustration"], "extra": {}}

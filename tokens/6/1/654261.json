Built in 1955, it is one of the finest examples of the architecture of Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier.\nLe Corbusier designed his Chapel with the four facades oriented towards the four cardinal points. In the south and in the east, the concave walls embrace the world, engaging into a dialogue with the surrounding mountains. In the north and in the west, the facades close up. The Eastern wall, with its two choirs, is the main answer to the project: an exterior choir for great Masses on pilgrimage days and an inside choir for the ordinary masses. The three towers are side chapels, even if their shapes remind of bell towers. They are the reminders of their predecessors in the ancient chapel. The supporting structure of the Chapel consists in 15 columns of reinforced concrete which are inserted into the walls which stabilize them.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8Nfj3EfVt7Woqcoixz9yUKvmxGDoi8vSLYjhoCkZhJn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVmJ6auAo7b4uXWvjLts9hFncFcyk6D3m35ZXtgZEXst4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb8Nfj3EfVt7Woqcoixz9yUKvmxGDoi8vSLYjhoCkZhJn", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz2CvXkJ1q5KLn8d98zg3P9N9eTJ81KmXfDF"], "tags": ["Interactive", "model", "3D", "historical", "building", "chapel", "lecorbusier", "postmodernism", "architecture"], "extra": {}}

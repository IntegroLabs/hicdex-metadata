{"__version": 1, "token_id": 659861, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "HIDDEN", "description": "How do you hide the word HIDDEN and yet reveal it in a way that can define it at the same time? Simple, all we need to do is write the word in black and italicize it and then duplicate the same word, but this time match the gradient background and offset the placement ever so slightly to create the illusion of three dimensionality. The result is a self-referential, self-defining, meta word that reveals itself when it's hidden. Apropos and ironic at the same time; kind of a walking contradiction of a word. Some words are strange like and I love them for it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTwMyzhFrXxjRsH4iENjT8AwwcwZ9W6Laga6zDqZAGY3k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXQ3YhXBhtXRVsLWpX4KFjPDcoraXCrQq6jbC4wAtFHtW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTwMyzhFrXxjRsH4iENjT8AwwcwZ9W6Laga6zDqZAGY3k", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

Released in 2020, the album is yet another Killer Mike and El-P\u2019s cocktail of modern throwback beats and traditional hardcore lyricism. \n\nOn the latest installment of this dystopian buddy-anticop scifi adventure, the duo continues to unloads on racist cops, systematic poverty, corporate media, and condemning the profit motive. All while saluting the sex workers union and slipping as many dick-jokes as they can on what could only be describe as a \u201clyrical slam dunk contest\u201d of increasingly elaborate insults. \n\nSonically, the album delivered everything you\u2019d expect from an El-P\u2019s production. A mighty dissonance of weird computer glitches melting with some of the hardest break-beats from the days of old. Run The Jewels have never been ashamed to wear their influence on their sleeves. You\u2019d notice elements of dancehall anthems, b-boy\u2019s ghetto blasters and old-school block-party bangers. All cross wired together to create some weird homemade retro-futuristic explosive doomsday device. Run The Jewels music has always been similar of their characters: unapologetically honest with their stranger-things-ness. They fully embrace their status as underdogs and unlikely heroes. I mean, how the hell could two middle-aged cult rappers became the new face of modern hip hop? It makes no sense. But once it goes off, it\u2019ll blew away everyone in the arena. \n\nCard is made from RTJ4 cover art.\nFigure is made from repainted GI Joe\u2019s Classified \u201cpimp daddy\u201d Destro figure, Mattel\u2019s WWE Mr.T figure, and Traptoys Krang x RTJ figure. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQxsUKW5jw9wEJk1FiZat2aPrRHrRJPaUFZWDVipPWUvK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWh9S2ko3BdTeYMdqj3gmD2brfy8fPr8ERbx78FacN5wo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQxsUKW5jw9wEJk1FiZat2aPrRHrRJPaUFZWDVipPWUvK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aXpmExefGTPY8Zw8WtaLyKK7AzdsvbZw2"], "tags": ["Digital", "Collage", "HipHop", "Albumart"], "extra": {}}

That\u2019s something I heard recently and it really resonated with me. Axios  recently reported that up to 40% of employees are currently looking to quit their jobs in something being dubbed \u201cThe Great Resignation.\u201d  The pandemic forced people to reconsider their work life balance and what they\u2019re willing to do to stay employed; and now with enhanced unemployment benefits being extended workers have the opportunity to take their time in finding their next ideal job.  For the time being they aren\u2019t forced into a job they don\u2019t want to do or feel safe doing under threat of poverty, the power balance has shifted from employer to employee.  Hopefully this is a step in the right direction for working conditions on the job, fair salaries, and a right to choose how we want to live our lives. Because an economy based on the threat of poverty isn\u2019t right, simple as that.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZHa8dAkYUHAxGPRovpUDYBvBcUPdfmVMyKZgutntL1cH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY7HujghxnS5nKQzcsJuoJQvLen9ZVe6Y6KLksHudpHuG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZHa8dAkYUHAxGPRovpUDYBvBcUPdfmVMyKZgutntL1cH", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "digitalart", "digitalart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "colorpalettes", "glitch", "glitchart", "glitchart", "TV", "television"], "extra": {}}

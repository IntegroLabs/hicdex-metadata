I can't make beautiful or good artwork like artists in general, so I just made my best.\n\nThis work was inspired by Young, Wild and Free - Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa songs which lately suddenly present on my YouTube home. When I listened to it I felt there was something that didn't match the current condition, then I replaced one word and turned out to change all the meaning.\n\nYoung Wild and Broke That's how I am now, or maybe you or maybe everyone. We always feel young even though our body has often asked to rest, We always feel wild but it turns out we are imprisoned in the routine, we never get wild because of a lot of fear, and we never wild even just to dream.\n\nAnd our acts are all broken, body, mind, mentality, time, life, nature, world. Everything has been broken, but it turns out, there's not much we can do but just survive, fix simple things, and express love even though it's not fine.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTWJ75W1LhXPXmzR1aRFRNy1M6RuMMBRRkGJBxxpcpKnT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP97wFwbhyLCTANrzY8GyjNN8mgzAYrjGvqu1wQTsB5Rw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTWJ75W1LhXPXmzR1aRFRNy1M6RuMMBRRkGJBxxpcpKnT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2RS7XRJmDcMd6FBatdZ3HbeqQRhVF4Y3j2"], "tags": ["uglyartwork", "snoopdogg", "wizzkhalifa"], "extra": {}}

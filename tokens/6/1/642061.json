{"__version": 1, "token_id": 642061, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Rising Moon", "description": "The painting shows a moonlit landscape by a body of water. These moonlight landscapes are characterised by dynamic cloud formations that atmospherically stage the full moon and its reflective play of light. Moonlight is particularly interesting in its capacity as a reflective light, as its various manifestations reveal the most diverse atmospheric phenomena. The atmosphere drawn here is typical of the romantics of the early 19th century.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcSQX6i8vHCgCNsuE1RnuENwRCq88cJDhEea4ygDh3cn9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbvZLspf3bA1z7UaknmteL6FEd7jZExcCqzKqimACmTZD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmbMLX5iKA2cmxhYcVscJ1URSq955yUgcSN1aWuWBkDiQ2", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcSQX6i8vHCgCNsuE1RnuENwRCq88cJDhEea4ygDh3cn9", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1RQRZEToscP9yRde16XoJZubtq4fLFyyWm"], "tags": ["painting", "landscape", "moon"], "extra": {}}

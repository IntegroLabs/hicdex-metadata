This work responds to a need of learning and distancing from a conservatoire-like, classical music aesthetic and writing. Thus, these twelve preludes are an approximation and experimentation on a 24 equal tempered tuning system. However, each and every one of them represent a particularity or idea linked to that musical system related to psychoacoustics and nature of sound. Composers such as Ives, HÃ¡ba or Wyschnegradsky already went in depth into this territory and arrived at similar conclusions on the behavior of sound and listener perception. These preludes put into practice these and other discoveries. May 2014. Full score and audio.","tags":["music","score","microtonal","sheet","piano","prelude"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/webm","uri":"ipfs://QmazqDYUtMQPJc4hbDz8YfAFLyr4HPnWgAnhm4PpBdLYhQ"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmazqDYUtMQPJc4hbDz8YfAFLyr4HPnWgAnhm4PpBdLYhQ","display_uri":"ipfs://QmPZYuGqc5kSddemd3NjdELix1PzFbqKoYZ8AxBgF3oGWn","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

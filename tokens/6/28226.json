The random color grid is plugged into a homemade GAN trained on hundreds of pictures of planets. The resulting GAN generated image serves as a philosophical commentary about the randomness of how our universe is “generated.” The random color grid for each image is included as unlockable content if you DM me @maxladabaumart on twitter. 13 planets will be minted.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYC1Me3MjARqwLgo6udojbBr2iTBvCqA2Mj1K4seoDKfD","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmYC1Me3MjARqwLgo6udojbBr2iTBvCqA2Mj1K4seoDKfD"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmR9uSGEu2fGfvcg6gzCxHuw4rCbBGb6m66hcGoGy1NjBx"},"supply":"1","transfered":3}

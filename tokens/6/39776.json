Durable, utilitarian and copied endlessly, it is a true testament of a great design. Designed as flatpack, easy to dismantle for transport with a shoulder strap and a neat slot for hanging your favourite iced teh tarik. This was the design render before its realisation as a physical object - 99% made out of recycled plastic, it was displayed at the National Art Gallery, Kuala Lumpur.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQ2hYqKHX9YekmNHGehPK8HpU1EEFo76oWH1dU4hpGoEL","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1R7mnKokM7Cc9XTobzv9h2PjvLG6zEiL2t"],"tags":["illustration","render","3d","mamak","malaysia","notoscale","recycledplastic","circulareconomy","malaysiana","malaysianobject"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmQ2hYqKHX9YekmNHGehPK8HpU1EEFo76oWH1dU4hpGoEL"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmeVwvmXFsq1rKFAxmqW87qbkZJk4rnQLTdc5yWsJDcV1Z"},"supply":"20","transfered":22}

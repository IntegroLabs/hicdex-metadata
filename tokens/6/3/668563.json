Exodus is a world that means travel, movement, intection and this journey is a exodus to inside. To see inside, to meet yourself, a great intention of being with yourself.\n\nWhen I beggining to make it, covid-19 pandemic isolation was about so start and i had to left where I live to live with my parents because I was without money and then I was with no friend just my parents and the only option I saw was to be with myself I was never being. So that is what is about. \n\nThis is the cover from this comic zine I made and if you're to buy it just contact me frfolle@gmail.com I can send you wherever you are.

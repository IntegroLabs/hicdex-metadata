The info, for the Golden Age 'Flower in glass’ painting this still life was sourced from, was lost when the file was flattened.  I have always been fascinated by this glitch & would love to know how to reproduce it.","tags":["fizzpop","stilllife","digital","contemporary","painting","art","flowers","glitch"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmPAFM7ViaBRkCAENRH2eQfPAoVZD136bmwSsaMa7RR8hk","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPAFM7ViaBRkCAENRH2eQfPAoVZD136bmwSsaMa7RR8hk","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNsRwNZypWL4E97DDud3hgrWeka7E5NFH7xYyERTTNgz2","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

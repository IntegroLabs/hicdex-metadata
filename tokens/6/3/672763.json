I just realized I was creating a 3D shape with some relief and not using this aspect. So let's move the camera a bit ? Wooo it's a new NFT yeah, hope you enjoy this series, I love this project, I found a lot of different visuals from it, soooo long series, lot of new NFTs :DDDD and ofc I want to be free and be able to create my art, that's my goal with translating my art into this NFT project Ambers of the Realtime. To be said if I become too rich it help me produce big projects. (and if u're curious about what I want to give to the world through my art, come on my twitch and say hello :D I want to talk to you!)\"\n\n\u00b0\u00a4*(\u00af\u00b4\u2605`\u00af)*\u00a4\u00b0\u2022\n\nA \uff4d \uff42\uff45\uff52\uff53\u2591\uff4f\uff46\u2591\uff54\uff48\uff45\u2591\uff32\uff45\uff41\uff4c\uff54\uff49\uff4d\uff45 \u301052-80\u3011 \ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude14\ud835\ude09\ud835\ude19\ud835\ude0c \ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude10\ud835\ude19\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude0c \ud835\ude34\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\n\n\u00a4\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af`\u2022\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022.\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af`\u2022\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022.\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af`\u2022\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022.\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af`\u2022\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022.\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af`\nI can produce high Res long length output of this kind of visuals, if you're interested DM me.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZCDShrqp2ABC6NZvvoHU7dghFPL6Y4oWZd1bzARTSuuz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTt6k16dxkPTfn8wRg7byQ2MWnHrkT8aRiKTffR2wTpfn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZCDShrqp2ABC6NZvvoHU7dghFPL6Y4oWZd1bzARTSuuz", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QFyjHEp3kfeyEuMAAcuc4oYZjmrMjn9vx"], "tags": ["matrix", "ASCII", "Realtime", "Aotr", "Ambersoftherealtime", "Touchdesigner", "3d", "art", "glitchart", "newmediaart", "reuse", "f_lse_no", "realtimemotiongraphics", "VJART", "VJ"], "extra": {}}

Weighted at the bottom so that they will always return to an upright position, they represent the ability to have success, overcome adversity, and recover from misfortune. The eyes of Daruma are seen as a mean to keep track of goals or big tasks. The recipient of the doll fills in one eye upon setting the goal, then the other upon fulfilling it. A one eyed Daruma is a symbol of a dream trying to be achieved.","tags":["BIRB","DARUMA","3D","HANDPAINT","DOLL","TALISMAN"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"model/gltf-binary","uri":"ipfs://QmXmxdPnBgBhPebQGY7PA8jknfTRCEh6y4qAsCmEbG7TmW"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXmxdPnBgBhPebQGY7PA8jknfTRCEh6y4qAsCmEbG7TmW","display_uri":"ipfs://QmWZq7tcEofTtpVrreDqstH8V8c1ouVWxDkbdTxBcb8t4f","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

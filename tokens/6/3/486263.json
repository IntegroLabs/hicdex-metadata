{"__version": 1, "token_id": 486263, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "POWER TO THE PEOPLE! OR WE TOP THE PEOPLE!", "description": "Since the 1960s, \"POWER TO THE PEOPLE\" has been used as a cultural rallying cry and political slogan for a wide variety of contexts. In this particular context, it's in regards to the BLM (Black Lives Matter) movement that swept across America in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, and so many other people of color. This work explores the collective anger and desire for real change for true and lasting equality and what happens when that moment is not met. I can't speak for African-Americans or people of color, but I can be an advocate for justice and stand up for what is right. When we scramble and rearrange \"POWER TO\", we get \"OR WE TOP\", implying a revolution of some sorts. I'm not advocating a coup or change via violence, but you have to imagine that after \"x\" amount of time of being treated less than equal, subjugated to hate/racism/violence/death/etc that at some point someone is going to pick up weapons and fight back. Malcom X famously said, \"By any means necessary\" at the Organization of Afro-American Unity back in 1964. The concept of using violence to fight oppression is as old as human existence. How do you change society without the use of violence? How do you change the hearts and minds of those who are filled with hate and racism? How do you connect generations of people and different ethnic groups together? We need better education that is compassionate, loving, understanding, and the caveat...accurate to what actually happened in the past. We need to acknowledge the sins of the past, in order to make real social and economic change for the betterment of society. What do I know? I'm just some artist spouting ideas from the heart and soul.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmenExsogVMfeRs413esu5Q6WghKtqDDZ53xTJ1Bz2KwQc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmahamfSc7amXW4c7QiHreBNhWs5HzSf92qtEQJ4br922N", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmenExsogVMfeRs413esu5Q6WghKtqDDZ53xTJ1Bz2KwQc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

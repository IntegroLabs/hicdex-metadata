It was going ok until the birthday boy starts calling me a loser and to get a real job. So I spit on him after asking him to stop several times. The dad see's the action and comes and punches me in the eye. They break us up from the melee. Next thing you know I am given an assault charge for spitting on the boy. I have to go to court in two weeks. WTF? The police found the whiskey bottle. I know I know, I should not have been drinking", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfLa92AYV8NYQh8h7a7cDVVob563ygFPtbhgYucTLsTxd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfLa92AYV8NYQh8h7a7cDVVob563ygFPtbhgYucTLsTxd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfLa92AYV8NYQh8h7a7cDVVob563ygFPtbhgYucTLsTxd", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LWc9d2ionFQRunxWt867ivRR4ab9QeLEz"], "tags": ["Collage", ""], "extra": {}}

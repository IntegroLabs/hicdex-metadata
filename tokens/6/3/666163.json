Who threatens illegal eviction by force if you don't do \"Group Therapy\" - put a space after the \"e\" in \"therapist\".\n   But you know... As extreme as this morning was, it's better than being sex trafficked. It's better than being homeless. But that's exactly how these cults gain and hold control: they target people with no other option but to join and stay.\n   The entire time I was in that hostage situation escaping sex trafficking I just couldn't feel fear. They're threatening similar types of violence where \u00ce'm at, but they can get away with it here with no legal consequences. It's one thing to face threats ready to slice a throat if they touch you, it's another for that power of defense to be stripped from you.\n   \"This\" is my safe house? The red flags were there from the beginning. I wanted to be wrong about this place.\n   It's still moving up in The World compared to where I came from, but ohhh boy did things just get terrifying.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb9Eh45SKs1PiM7VQkoS5pu3vehf9rUzhrNbTQrcdGusi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUddAGYewv7W4wQmnSNTA8XYdVshsVxbtahNzShvazx8J", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb9Eh45SKs1PiM7VQkoS5pu3vehf9rUzhrNbTQrcdGusi", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1WSB79B4pMAqzsfhqox2FzCRkf15ybZ4GD"], "tags": ["Integration", "Cults", "Horror", "Liminality", "glitch", "flower"], "extra": {}}

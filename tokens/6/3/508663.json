{"__version": 1, "token_id": 508663, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Batara Kala", "description": "In addition to appearing in the Murwakala story, the name Batara Kala is also associated with the myth of lunar and solar eclipses, which generally speak of the gods agreeing to regulate the distribution of tirta amarta (holy water). For the drinker, this water can effectively live forever. Kala managed to take a sip, but was stopped by Dewi Ratih (Goddess of the Moon). As soon as the holy water reached his throat, Batara Vishnu reacted and immediately thrust his chakra into Kala's neck, separating his head from his body. Because his head was hit by holy water, Kala's head floated in the eternal sky. Kala's annoyance against Dewi Ratih is endless. He managed to eat the moon on certain nights, and there was an eclipse. However, because Kala is only a form with a severed head, after being swallowed, the Moon Goddess shines again.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUNR3FXWP1nDibpSD6bdejGmeyK8twx8KTVc7He1wHcXG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSTGh2JTnXb6fuMSPyHG1pk8ozRM9JGErS73Agpwe8CEY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUNR3FXWP1nDibpSD6bdejGmeyK8twx8KTVc7He1wHcXG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dfcpJu4cyYbhfNJtPo8zKfCbPjCT9UxqC"], "tags": ["Batara", "Kala", "Illustration", "design"], "extra": {}}

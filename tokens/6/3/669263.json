They will ask about this time; this era; history revealed. They will hold our generation to account. They will ask why didn't we do more to right the wrongs of our day? How would we answer them? What would we say? Did we really make that much of a difference? Could we have done better? Were we part of the problem? How do we defend ourselves? Should we defend ourselves? I'm in denial defending myself now; the ego wants to defend. But the deeper we dive the deeper we go. We all know the truth, we were all part of the problem in one way or another.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTKiVGkyMzC1kJy9iCMk4pE9GGrAQ8ezGZfESaeadAUYX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdkyrHNruk8CWgH6QxbXFLcbneLD8UkofNwiH84vvBpHC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTKiVGkyMzC1kJy9iCMk4pE9GGrAQ8ezGZfESaeadAUYX", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

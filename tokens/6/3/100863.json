This poem talks about Love. In this series I weave together sound, poetry and VR art that I create. It's a carpet of creative expression - a deeply satisfying experience, where each stage has its own play and rhythm. As if the year has gone through the seasons. The poems are captured in moments of insights about different aspects of life. And then the art is created as an illusrtation to it and further the music.","tags":["poem","3dart","videoart"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmUjjqJSx8sGXyJFjFNDkio7tdxQ1p9TAEQELD3sg53vcK"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUjjqJSx8sGXyJFjFNDkio7tdxQ1p9TAEQELD3sg53vcK","display_uri":"ipfs://QmUb8cF75koBpEpn8VMtGu3Jg6qJswWVwPcAAavTk8ZVFG","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 499263, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BLATHERSKITES", "description": "What the heck is a blatherskite? According the various dictionaries, we can define a blatherskite as: (A babbling, foolish person). Seems apropos for a lot of my work. I prefer the term a blathering blatherskite! It's like an absurd badge of honor. Why this word? This is a rare a syntax crystal as it is made of 2 separate words: BLATHER & SKITES for a total of 13 letters long! The longer the word gets the less and less likely it will be able to be a syntax crystal because of the complexities of the variations. There are limits to certain parameters like words have to be real words for one, prefixes and suffixes are another, so are letter combinations, usages, and frequencies, and other factors. I just love how ridiculous this one is just for the sake of the meta quality of it all.

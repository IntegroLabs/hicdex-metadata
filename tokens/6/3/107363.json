Wait, didn't this throne belong to Sabrina? Maybe Beca just stole it for herself‚Ä¶ Okay, as I said before Beca's not from this realm, and now that B√™ told her about all the craziness going on with Rupi and Zel she's very very very angry. Can you take all this cat anger? üòæüí¢ Well, Rupi and Zel definitely can. Although Beca is super angry at them, hissing and meowing in a very scary way, Rupi and Zel don't really care about it. They really just want to play around, get crazy on some space adventures and just enjoy all this crazy experience. Let's just hope that Beca doesn't eat them alive. What do you think will be their next adventure? Will they have a next adventure? Paws crossed for these two little ones. Stay tuned for the next adventure, humans. A big meow to you all.üêæ P.S.: this was a collab with @eternagnose who made this incredible soundtrack!","tags":["cat","angry","sountrack","mp4","collage","cute","space","planet","stars","mars","chillingadventuresofsabrina","brazilianartist","catlover","collectible","serie"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmVk5mimusoMtiqb43xLmgTdjfx4cAhnmuhwk3y9aV6Xgr"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVk5mimusoMtiqb43xLmgTdjfx4cAhnmuhwk3y9aV6Xgr","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZYxqhzYN9WdoFLJrGCcsRsxTQszPMV2fm5g7o6hgLkXg","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

In the Western tradition, it is believed that such a plant brings good fortune to the finder, especially if found by chance. Legend has it that each of the leaves of a quadruple leaf represents something specific: the first represents hope, the second faith, the third love, and the fourth good fortune.","tags":["clover","earth","planet","plant"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmcsZT3tUb4H3AsqRQcsAosNFAWC9ukXRewmkB6cfXE1TX"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcsZT3tUb4H3AsqRQcsAosNFAWC9ukXRewmkB6cfXE1TX","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

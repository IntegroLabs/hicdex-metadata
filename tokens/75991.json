Russ lives downtown in Erie, PA. He asked me for a dollar the other day. I told him that I would trade him for a photograph and that if I made any money from it, I would find him and split it with him. Russ definitely doesn't think I'm comin back... The first $100 is for Russ. The next $100 I will keep for expenses. The rest will go to a local charity/mission/center of my choice.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUPz4WxUSppCuV81UC5Y8WZAE4AGDnreqESnVXBN1CX8F","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1dsuRQ4Yxn71wK3yUMZXdQRgvKrnhTwQiA"],"tags":["Russ","Eskaton","art","Something","Strange","Charity","Homeless","Mission",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmUPz4WxUSppCuV81UC5Y8WZAE4AGDnreqESnVXBN1CX8F"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmYgN7iqeUUvkAGswoWVQxmonNzPqWvB4ZhuAmqAfD1phK"},"supply":"100","transfered":106}

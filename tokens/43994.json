I hope that crypto art NFTs bring more beauty into the world. This work is the first I published on my journey into digital art starting in 2011, falling in love with possibilities of simulated media. The reference photograph was taken with an iPhone of all things. A lot of virtual watercolor, layering, hand painting and filters (including Filter Forge) went into this. 2592x1936, many details in image metadata.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPk4TkjFQbVQy6dp3gf4q8VFsaN4YcQcbyAiDnymGsZcW","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1art8z8LXimWdV44CQiXCnMYk6EwFFZsyv"],"tags":["impressionist","field","mountain","earthday","corelpainter","filterforge","iphone","WorldArtDay2021"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmPk4TkjFQbVQy6dp3gf4q8VFsaN4YcQcbyAiDnymGsZcW"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmQGkcKyJAPYHz4z6nXwUQpXCtDjbamJwpdXZomVZgkifC"},"supply":"125","transfered":223}

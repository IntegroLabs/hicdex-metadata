Finally, you reached the end. You bloomed, bloomed to the fullest you felt. But life doesn\u2019t stop there. Ahead of you is the next chapter. You look ahead, you see glitches that need fixes. You look back, now your bloom glitches. Something seems wrong. There\u2019s always something. Because life isn\u2019t about blooming, it\u2019s a journey, to rot and grow on repeat. That\u2019s the reality. A realisation that you\u2019re always learning and failing, growing and improving. That will never stop. That\u2019s the point of this life, it challenges you to be the best version of you in the end.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZWSbRuoW5WdTxSUypp4d5RPTp5TUfpcGeiteroGi3n25", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1ZLdssHoFmvCMBcPA4egvUidMgY3FHi1pe"], "tags": ["Abstract", "Glitch", "Rose", "Architecture", "ContemporaryArt", "CleanNFT"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmZWSbRuoW5WdTxSUypp4d5RPTp5TUfpcGeiteroGi3n25"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmZM9UxtFVAegExPjkBCnkGRWJCaFZkStoye6EvA1mkCfN"}, "supply": "44", "transfered": 54}

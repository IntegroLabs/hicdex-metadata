The visuals on the backdrop are extracted from a video I produced for one of my old songs. Also the sound is part of a track I produced.  An E-sus chord flows all along the track: how could it be otherwise? The main image comes from a photo I took to the \"Santissimo Crocifisso\" Church's portal, in Castegneto Carducci (Tuscany, Italy) Take this lysergic glitchy holy madness.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmX94QYXu7FEEMzrz3hK8CDsevSx5Y5NNZVhsSiqn3s9LF","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1X2aQPB3C7RBNhfbGZQBPrJcvpy9Rhtg6t"],"tags":["digital","visual","glitch","datamoshing","motiongraphics","motion","techno","jesus"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmX94QYXu7FEEMzrz3hK8CDsevSx5Y5NNZVhsSiqn3s9LF"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmPmXwbxmMpZkZPMLaobjk5ajN3gi2Ee3AYjijzbYbhgXU"},"supply":"22","transfered":24}

Lets simplify it a bit, if this earth is 40 years old, then we have been on it for only 30 minutes. We have evolved on mastering our circumstances, we kept on evolving so that in 30 minutes, we have crossed from the caves to the houses, from the pyramids to modern day structures, from the Babylonian temples (in the illustration) and hanging gardens to the the future cities; until earth got too small to discover we moved to space. This crossing haven\u2019t stopped for a second, instead we crossed from letters to signals, from codes to blockchains, from assets to money, and here we are, still crossing, to the edge of a whole new era, from phones to smarter phones, from money to virtual money, from stepping on the moon to settling on mars... A human whom doesn't evolve is dead, and this is why we are a race that is ever-crossing.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeCEeieRTfjqv8HpB3y3Lyi1KYzmtydhCubE8VJWHaimN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1QcEroj6wRk4oaQGhSE5KdxLckhnrP66M4"], "tags": ["Past", "present", "future"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmeCEeieRTfjqv8HpB3y3Lyi1KYzmtydhCubE8VJWHaimN"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://Qmf4aeKR2UkcSshi71oQFAH1fBay5NtTReJjjkr5bzdw3b"}, "supply": "50", "transfered": 50}

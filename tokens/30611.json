The cover was created by  Storm Thorgerson, following keyboardist Richard Wrightâ€™s suggestion for a classy, bold design. My older brother was a huge Pink Floyd fan so I was always intrigued by their music. I would sneak into his bedroom, a strict no-Jon zone, to dub his collection on to tape. I fell in love with this album. Listening to it now is like bathing in a vat of warm tea.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYUPoaNmS6fXF8PVYk1nhstEza3TcSfyrvE2ca72WQmQ2","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1TeLXGCQYuJyeSJcbdynDP2nh8t1A7AocZ"],"tags":[""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmYUPoaNmS6fXF8PVYk1nhstEza3TcSfyrvE2ca72WQmQ2"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmaMeESKCVb3XWRsTLcPWz7oGDsM64wRTm4DsMR2FvEYtc"},"supply":"1","transfered":6}

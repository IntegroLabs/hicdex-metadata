{"__version": 1, "token_id": 696912, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "IN THE LIGHT", "description": "Anagrams aren't new to this book, but this one is unique. We started off by using the words IN THE LIGHT. I wanted to play with the simplicity of only a few words and extrapolate a predicate and manifest it by shifting letters from the right to the left. If the letters didn't match up in the word, the shifted further down or became the beginning of a new word. The full sentence reads, IN THE LIGHT, HE LIT NIGHT. It's a fully functional sentence that stands out on its own. To me it has a few dualities that resonate. One being that someone is able to lite night in the middle of day. Or is it day because he lit the night? The other duality is how this is flat and 2 dimensional, and yet takes on a sculptural aspect. I particularly enjoy the spiral like cascading quality to how the words shift over. This work spoke a lot to me in it's potential. I'm going to make a separate series not related to this one based on this one experiment. Very excited about this discovery.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQHHhpbwe8VWxakTaRUK9Y8bAefUvdiEXJQ9RLz2ZdcKw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeRRBtBqbfHb2GYBeg5ocaMcGJbuWRTHHzjZSTxpSREKY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQHHhpbwe8VWxakTaRUK9Y8bAefUvdiEXJQ9RLz2ZdcKw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

John has allowed artists to use his window concept to add our own unique touches and incorporate our styles with his. In learning what my style would be, I felt that this was a perfect opportunity to create a window of my own! I am grateful that John has been so welcoming to all of the artists who have used his style as a foundational concept to a semi original art piece.","tags":["john4john","gif","glitch","window","cat","lights","grid","spacegod","tv","gold","fuzz","static"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmQ8zsXyQNz9tg3a3vAoppeHVUAam9aBQPnqitfroVdS95"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQ8zsXyQNz9tg3a3vAoppeHVUAam9aBQPnqitfroVdS95","display_uri":"ipfs://QmQ8zsXyQNz9tg3a3vAoppeHVUAam9aBQPnqitfroVdS95","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

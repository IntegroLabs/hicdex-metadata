As the haiku reads, \"ALL FORGOTTEN AND SET ASIDE WIND SCATTERING LEAVES OVER THE FIELDS\" (Why are we reading a haiku?) I thought that too when I was making this, but Watts' story of how he wrote this when he was 17 really struck me and all of the anxiety of showing my appreciation melted away. Watts was away at school at Canterbury in the autumn of 1932. He noticed it was \"windy, with fallen leaves skittering along roads and fields.\" and he was trying to understand and figure out how spiritual masters were able to achieve their moments of Zen. He was focusing on what his mental state of mind should be and pondering 'of what should be meant by me'. Then it clicked in his mind. Through the process of overthinking and frustration, he finally let go and achieved a Zen-like state for the first time. In his own words, \"And instantly my weight vanished. I owned nothing. All hang-ups disappeared. I walked on air. Thereupon I composed a haiku\". I get this feeling every time I finish a work of art. Why not make this wonderful poem that sparked an entire journey for Alan Watts and create a mantra mandala to share with all of you and thus sparking joy within me?

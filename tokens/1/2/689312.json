{"__version": 1, "token_id": 689312, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Seahorse, Guardian of Reefs", "description": "The seahorse is an animal protector and companion of coral reefs all over the world. It secretes a substance that nourishes the reef as it swims by and emits vibratory frequencies that strengthen the corals and reef creatures. \n\nA person holding a seahorse will know good health for a time, but seahorse cannot sustain anyone forever for they are mortal themselves.\n\nAccording to its age, its color will change, and at the time of its death, it will take the color of the corals and will let itself die. The coral will then merge with it and integrate it into its design.\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQWKxhPAGZ5ybMfJGBwNMREtt6fTVfeiGJsBoqEstsRp1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdtUpcV4auMNCPyMiwsiFMS6Jjy5QW4X3JnA9u4w46Wgi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQWKxhPAGZ5ybMfJGBwNMREtt6fTVfeiGJsBoqEstsRp1", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld", "coral", "reef", "seahorse"], "extra": {}}

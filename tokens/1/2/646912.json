It is also performed by the Minahasa people of North Sulawesi. It is a dance by the young adults, & was used originally to show interest to a suitor using a handkerchief (lenso). This art is dedicated to my grandmother who is Ambonese, who was displaced multiple times from wars and ended up in Netherlands. She came from a lovely island with beautiful beaches, mother of pearl jewellery, and ikat cloth.\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago of over 17000 islands. There are many tribes, with their own individual dances and costumes, spread along these islands. I want to share with you the dances of my family heritage and of places I live.

The particles in this have a more non-local view of the field, composing different downsamplings and upsamplings rather than using a direct neighborhood calculation. Here, dense regions rotate coherently while less dense regions seem to become incoherent, leading to a population of flowering, but ultimately disappearing, vortices. @ngutten\n\n1024 x 1024 mp4", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYzskWH9J7o3ENgUBpqntnGcFNX66AHVEonZ5Rred967S", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfMjEnvtn647bbeETevaV99hLG8HpZSkBxX5fZrDnbaXh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYzskWH9J7o3ENgUBpqntnGcFNX66AHVEonZ5Rred967S", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SWsPUdLvr4KCuZxN69ju2bZruggLbYhjx"], "tags": ["swarm", "automaton", "video", "simulation", "generative", "neuralnetwork"], "extra": {}}

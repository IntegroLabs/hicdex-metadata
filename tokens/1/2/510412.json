In their world there is always vanity and idleness. Mice don't starve. Any individual can find not only a mate, but also food, which has become a very important argument when choosing this body.\n\nI had a lot of relatives. We lived as a large colony in a system of tunnels under a huge field. Everything was fine except for one terribly annoying factor \u2013 the absolute impossibility of privacy. A conscious being needs peace and its own space. Otherwise, life turns into hell.\n\nOne day I left. I was lucky. Quickly enough, I found a free mink with someone's unclaimed supplies. Life has become good. There were enough supplies for the whole winter. It was a happy time of peace and quiet. And at the end of spring, the earth suddenly trembled. There was a growing noise and suddenly, the mink crumbled and I was crushed by something very heavy. Death was instantaneous. I died a happy, lonely, well-fed mouse.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXXifeU9Z35ZkvTaPuTKN9oqvdh4uVFDrL93Mn3GvSRBG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYF9oUL29C1pB3VYLMb1aXmS96Zge3gPT4CRfr6japeYX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXXifeU9Z35ZkvTaPuTKN9oqvdh4uVFDrL93Mn3GvSRBG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YxuH9J2fMdEQ3wXX5Fi2dfAapsAJkKBiC"], "tags": ["42", "EndlessHistory", "DigitalArt", "Adventure", "ScienceFiction", "Cryptoapostol6", "Cryptoapostol12", "ArtificialIntelligence"], "extra": {}}

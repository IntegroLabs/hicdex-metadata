His words helped to open my mind to the possibility of being a more creative individual and living a happy and satisfied life. In TO BE IS TO DECEIVE, we examine that part of our lives that (pardon the pun) lies below the surface. By the sheer virtue of existing, we all have wants and needs for survival hidden deep within the darkest parts of our personalities that most of the time we're completely unaware of. Whether it's money, sex, power, etc. our psyches have intense drives of their own seemingly beyond our control. These impulse/urges we have are guided by societal indoctrination and rituals that thankfully restrain us from certain activities or proclivities that would have lead us to becoming more animalistic. Is it possible to be and not deceive? Can we be completely in tune with our subconscious desires and instincts? One of the things that Watts said that struck me as poignant was to asking the question of \"Have you ever explored your dark side?\" He mentioned that, \"...in the whole scheme of life, there has to be the shadow.\" There cannot be light without darkness; it's always there, lurking.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmazmU8RdLPJVMqjt9NoqhA5SUas7SoYaJZmUArUnbLGVC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTCekz4hmfDiKdXGWeZjoURQvtzT9daoVzn6aDseinJHe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmazmU8RdLPJVMqjt9NoqhA5SUas7SoYaJZmUArUnbLGVC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

No more rotten teeth. No more painful bones. Free from the endless grieve. Free from the missing love.  Finally free. No regret, no more.  I’m deep into a dream. And everyone is in home.

Not a single one. - This is some poetry for my mom, she passed away in January. My dad also died 10 years ago and she really missed him. She was really tired, and sick, and poor, but now she's finally free. - Bryce 3D, Illustrator, Photoshop, and a Pilot Parallel 3,5mm for the custom type. 3000x3000 .png + 3d .obj + .ai illustrator files.","tags":["axelxavier","ethereal","dreamscape","3d","surreal","metalheart","depthcore","softcore","poetry","y2k","2000"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmU7BSHktrjBLr97w6Zfx6uSRonMaDBGeTnRiYEzrUeKHz"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmU7BSHktrjBLr97w6Zfx6uSRonMaDBGeTnRiYEzrUeKHz","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTeMu9mgrL1cZg7YAdyzvsZ7pgDSz9JyxBkC7po46fA8q","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

According to Hesiod\u2019s Theogony, after Prometheus, a fire god and divine trickster, had stolen fire from heaven and bestowed it upon mortals, Zeus, the king of the gods, determined to counteract this blessing. He accordingly commissioned Hephaestus (a god of fire and patron of craftsmen) to fashion a woman out of earth, upon whom the gods bestowed their choicest gifts. In Hesiod\u2019s Works and Days, Pandora had a jar containing all manner of misery and evil. Zeus sent her to Epimetheus, who forgot the warning of his brother Prometheus and made Pandora his wife. She afterward opened the jar, from which the evils flew out over the earth. Hope alone remained inside, the lid having been shut down before she could escape.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYrQURHoiwzRJE3ZBygXiw46PkTgkDwdcq7PLg2fJy2tN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbB127vNMyP9KUBM3KKS7G6gKEs4KqAdLFwxEq58gGKZe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYrQURHoiwzRJE3ZBygXiw46PkTgkDwdcq7PLg2fJy2tN", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz2M8v8NqMKfZ2cdhRc2Ybz64goQpu3BHUYe"], "tags": ["Monochrome", "blackwhite", "Glitch", "Glitchart", "Yigoart", "Pandora", "Evil", "Darkness", "Datamosh"], "extra": {}}

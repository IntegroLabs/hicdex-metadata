(ALAN WATTS)", "description": "Part 2 of our mini-diptych is the other half of the quote from one of our favorite philosopher Alan Watts. This quote references on how to gain agency to access the universe's great power. We spend so much of our time thinking, talking, and doing things. We think this what life is all about and the universe is there, but an intangible concept, but stop for a moment and just observe; this is the true nature of the universe. The obvious is that it just is; the abstract is an unknown mystery that it's definitive purpose may or may not be ever revealed. Be still and experience the universe around you and within you. Let your mind be calm and the universe might reveal itself. Meditation helps us feel connection to the Earth and the universe. Finding those Zen moments can be difficult with so many things in our lives going on at the same time. So many distractions, so many responsibilities; it can so difficult to even begin to meditate. That being said, If you can carve a small amount of time for yourself everyday...meditating can be extremely rewarding on many levels of our conscious and unconscious existence.

In this digital painting, I wanted to zoom into the synapse and imagine the electric, invisible chemistry that happens there; a moment of infinite potential.","tags":["digitalart","digitalpainting","neurology","buddhism","breath","synapse","science","chemistry","electricity"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmfCuxeDYYmv3vx9MUKutPs11Stju1SMPSAV8ASNbNyu7y"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmfCuxeDYYmv3vx9MUKutPs11Stju1SMPSAV8ASNbNyu7y","display_uri":"ipfs://QmcmFS3XWzngn5yrMaKfr37Wc63zXqq9VsBTp4TVWBArPd","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

The image came to me one day I listened to this song on my way to work. The motif stood before me clear as day.\nThe piece is also a small homage to one of my favourite artists, Edvard Munch. He was a master with lines. Both visible and invisible. \n\nFor this piece I wont write any poem. I will just encourage you all to listen to the song, because those lyrics says it all.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYCm7DZ482Gbs4wXmPGFJeeK95LrkBwMEP7sQ6efvvreq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYUbMfYuGfhtwPzfxJ2NC4DaUgwRwu4TUWqJCqmwb5sjn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYCm7DZ482Gbs4wXmPGFJeeK95LrkBwMEP7sQ6efvvreq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TW3YfKY44cS1uKEEfsnyuNFbkzydeayq9"], "tags": ["drawing", "digital", "fineart", "darkart", "darkart", "symbolism", "death", "skull", "portrait", "blackandwhite", "procreate", ""], "extra": {}}

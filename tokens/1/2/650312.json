She passed away last January. It's hard to believe its been a year. I used her date of birth to choose the colors and patterns for this one. She was a fiery little Sicilian woman and I miss her dearly. I'm doing 100 editions of this mandala in honor of how old she would be this year. Ti voglio bene e mi manchi tanto nonna <3 ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQoawcT4MN91Cq3HpguGgaTyvPz2BWPim7uEZhgchvNsb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNndwL1EGodhnKSC1Encz6nDvf9ZieJdJ8QLZBABZjAAh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQoawcT4MN91Cq3HpguGgaTyvPz2BWPim7uEZhgchvNsb", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2WYko4XXaV4B5mzjguTeRkkgw8LyB2jA2d"], "tags": ["mandala", "mandalas", "color", "animations", "movement", "memories", "special", "grandmother"], "extra": {}}

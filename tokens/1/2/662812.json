One sheet of 100 stamps with an upside-down image of a blue airplane escaped detection. The biplane pictured in the design is the famous JN-4-H \u201cJenny\u201d modified by replacing the front cockpit with a mail compartment.\n\nOn View\nCurrently on exhibit at the National Postal Museum", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdzbmGgVt8RRpfzigMq267PieCzCAyReHpLgFUxVErzG8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdzbmGgVt8RRpfzigMq267PieCzCAyReHpLgFUxVErzG8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdzbmGgVt8RRpfzigMq267PieCzCAyReHpLgFUxVErzG8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Z9ViyeZPU1WMQ4bXRnW2ed7DbZE63pjyB"], "tags": ["history"], "extra": {}}

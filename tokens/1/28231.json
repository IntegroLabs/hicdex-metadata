The electric guitar, now that's much harder to cut and paste. Also I discovered that some musics have letters attached to them like A, B,C and so on. If you put different lettered musics at the same time it sounds terrible. You can alternate between them, though. You don't have to worry about the letters if it's drums. The drums have NUMBERS though and you have to use numbers that match. I made these musical discoveries myself.#NFT","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZNrJVo6f8f1TWATxaT9o6QfePX1y9vPLJZDZLVGjcMmx","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmZNrJVo6f8f1TWATxaT9o6QfePX1y9vPLJZDZLVGjcMmx"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmR8K5AJDUz6GNvX6L83uzktxW1BEU5GK8cPFQjdND5rgh"},"supply":"21","transfered":14}

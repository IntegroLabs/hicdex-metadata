These particles are the unpredictable result of a low-resolution process of photogrammetry, a method that renders 3D models by overlapping photographs of objects. Foraging through the marginal residues of the software\u2019s digital processes, Mora dissected the digital landscapes. Wherever glitches surfaces, she meticulously isolated them, enlarged them, and brought them to life, creating a multitude of microorganisms-looking glitches that inhabit a similarly photogrammed landscape.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmds8BD3m4a7zSn4sWvqq41sHk8CBY7HbJbrgmY3dH2VFk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTLxkkpf18LiTDvQacZBYEWfXSKsAp7QdPxxGDTFTeu3c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1LKJrRv5v9M8sNMjZfVVXen1uZFL8gsUFN"], "tags": ["3D", "digital", "worldbuilding", "landscape", "digitalresidues", "glitches", "fantasy", "nature", "photogrammetry"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://Qmds8BD3m4a7zSn4sWvqq41sHk8CBY7HbJbrgmY3dH2VFk"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmVVnEboy3aia2vaHJGHKL9A4CpfB4md5H1HdorfhuSKMX"}, "supply": "5", "transfered": 0}

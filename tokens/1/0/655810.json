A kind of shadow that gives me my own visibility and allows me to look at myself where I am not: mirror utopia. But to the extent that I really exist and have a kind of return effect where I am, the mirror is also heterotopia; the mirror is also a heterotopia, insofar as I see myself there, to the extent that I have a flashback effect where I am; I discover from the mirror that I am not where I am, as I see myself there. At the bottom of this virtual space, which is on the other side of the mirror, in a sense, due to this look directed at me, I return to myself and begin to direct my eyes towards myself and to form again where I find myself; The mirror functions like a heterotopia in the sense that it makes this place I occupy the moment I look in the mirror both absolutely real and absolutely unreal.\n\n-Michel Foucault", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXF6pu99GDLk1B3p7WocYGC5ztHf26tVyCtWHwW5swpvo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNkw19KpNRwWjzkvWW9cZSy2WRqazJJH2sK6M2gnfkG4B", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXF6pu99GDLk1B3p7WocYGC5ztHf26tVyCtWHwW5swpvo", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MrXLw7buYx4YamcCeqSE4FdAWuowdixBX"], "tags": ["#experimental#photography#monochrome#bw#blackandwhite#selfportrait#heterotopia"], "extra": {}}

(ALAN WATTS)", "description": "This work and the next image are part of a mini-diptych based off of some quotes from surprise, surprise Alan Watts. As much as we think we are independent of our environment with our lives and thoughts, we are a part of everything around us. We are part of the earth, the air, the water, the fire, the stars...all of it. Next time you feel lost, be found in the knowledge that you are part of everything happening at this moment in the entire universe. Alan Watts spoke about this at length during many of his lectures in his lifetime. When he said, \"You cannot catch it. You cannot get rid of it.\" he was talking about how we are all inescapably linked to the universe and that we are the universe experiencing itself. Our individual consciousnesses collectively endure endless moments concurrently. You are it...you are the universe.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUQScEbDTWRVuq5bxUkDSKfLp8gMeFVTVjbAzDH927YA1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfWcq6vwCf7Y38VwBQULwfsRKWJc8bXFuaX1YWwiQa6Za", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUQScEbDTWRVuq5bxUkDSKfLp8gMeFVTVjbAzDH927YA1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

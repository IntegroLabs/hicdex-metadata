Outside of Southeast Asia, it is worn by Javanese, Malays and Portuguese Eurasians in Australian Cocos Islands and Christmas Island, coastal India and Sri Lanka, Macau as well as South Africa. The complete outfit is known as \"sarong kebaya\".\n\nKebaya is an upper garment opened at the front traditionally made from lightweight fabrics such as brocade, cotton, gauze, lace, or voile, sometimes adored with embroidery. The front is secured with either buttons, pins, or brooches. The lower garment for the outfit is known as sarong, kemben or kain, a long piece of cloth wrapped and tucked around the waist or under the armpits, either made out of batik, ikat, songket or tenun.\n\nKebaya is officially recognised as the national costume of Indonesia, and its fashion icon, although it is more popularly worn by Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese people. In Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, it is recognised as one of its ethnic costumes especially among Malay and Peranakan communities. The style of sarong kebaya vary from place to place throughout the region.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPWPN8wxp4VhW5Ni5pCKEwvR2ndM5PX2hEhwhXVfqtNn5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeFtyZkc8148yGyh1pjYribQLcJfYijGUp9CdPLUGSnbC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPWPN8wxp4VhW5Ni5pCKEwvR2ndM5PX2hEhwhXVfqtNn5", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1i96xcuq977irdWZain23XiBEj1ETg17sM"], "tags": ["illustration", "sundanesekebaya", "Indonesianculture", "semirealistic", "digitalpainting"], "extra": {}}

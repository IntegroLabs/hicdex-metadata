Simple, use the word you in French, English, Spanish and use the number 2. (Ok, hold up Andrew...what are talking about?) Let's back up and dive in head first to understand this better. In French, one of the words for you is: VOUS. In English, obviously we use the word YOU. In Spanish, one of the words for you is: TU. Let's combine all of this together and stack them starting with the longest word. VOUS (4 letters) YOU (3 letters) TU (2 letters) 2 (1 number). So in essence we create a way to reduce everything down via characters. They all mean the exact same thing with the exception of the number which is a homophone of TU. So simple, yet incredibly complex. This one made my day when it was discovered!

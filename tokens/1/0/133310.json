Also projected onto a large LED screen plays the work of Sky Goodman. Analog video feedback created with vintage mixers merge with newer, digital software to create an installation that you can only visit when caught between the waking world and dreams. \"Not all that Crumbles isn't Gone\" loops one both screens and reminds us what reigns eternal in a temporal universe.

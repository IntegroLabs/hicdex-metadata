People who choose gray instead of green; imprison living beings behind walls made of metal, concrete, and glass; use technology as a weapon against the Earth, could not oppose the destructive power, which has evolved itself for millions of years and survived thousands of disasters. Nature has evolved once again to face the disaster called human, and now mankind is trapped in the concrete jungles he built with his own hands. This new order, where the hunter and the prey change roles, is now a \"zoo\" for humans.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf7AdpKGJy3mcWTV39qzff9gCvUSJZFU9gnUpfpufN6PE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUnx2PnpaPALwMMY1F8Hx2p7LExYtZyNGrmrawWHxxDGN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf7AdpKGJy3mcWTV39qzff9gCvUSJZFU9gnUpfpufN6PE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NEykKsVmHwz1wivHefKGxzTSMPYCN9a8H"], "tags": ["zoo", "animals", "nature", "flamingo", "human", "city", "cyberpunk", "dystopian", "sci-fi", "monsters", "originalcontentartist", "manifest", "architecture", "conceptart", "illustration", "3dart"], "extra": {}}

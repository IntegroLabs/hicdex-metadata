{"__version": 1, "token_id": 132210, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "23 Yuki Onna", "description": " It\u2019s a rare occurrence to find a tunnel from \u2018The Inner Earth\u2019 to \u2018The Outer Earth\u2019 that isn\u2019t well hidden, yet every decade or so in the midst of winter, tunnels will start to appear in the forested areas of Japan. Fearing having these tunnels discovered by the humans of \u2018The Outer Earth\u2019, (more commonly referred to as \u2018The Other Side\u2019), inhabitants of an Eastern Kingdom work tirelessly to seal up these tunnels as  fast as possible. Although not a common occurrence, sightings of humans from \u2018The Inner World\u2019 do occur during these missions, with the Legend of the Yuki Onna, the snow women spreading fast across Japan. Original protocol when seen by the humans of \u2018The Outer Earth\u2019 was to exterminate the human, however there were multiple times in which these humans had gotten away, or escaped. Eventually humans from \u2018The Inner World\u2019 got wind of the stories told about the Yuki Onna, how they freeze humans to the bone with their breathe, how they trick humans with crying babies and kill those who try and take the babies from them. They soon began playing up to the legend, bringing their babies and younger siblings on watch to scare of the humans of \u2018The Outer Earth\u2019 out of the area.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRWaW5VXzELnD6pZe4HMxpPZV8Dh4iVyvnQgwFEMfqN5K", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYmyGzv5q86rAZ2WR6WWaWnzTwTpcrZfF9upT5Do4iMfR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRWaW5VXzELnD6pZe4HMxpPZV8Dh4iVyvnQgwFEMfqN5K", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1c8pcwHmx4gsxTejDjX3rL9aR9wpA2LDVQ"], "tags": ["YukiOnna", "cute", "mythology", "anime", "manga", "icon", "blink"], "extra": {}}

Fearing having these tunnels discovered by the humans of ‘The Outer Earth’, (more commonly referred to as ‘The Other Side’), inhabitants of an Eastern Kingdom work tirelessly to seal up these tunnels as  fast as possible. Although not a common occurrence, sightings of humans from ‘The Inner World’ do occur during these missions, with the Legend of the Yuki Onna, the snow women spreading fast across Japan. Original protocol when seen by the humans of ‘The Outer Earth’ was to exterminate the human, however there were multiple times in which these humans had gotten away, or escaped. Eventually humans from ‘The Inner World’ got wind of the stories told about the Yuki Onna, how they freeze humans to the bone with their breathe, how they trick humans with crying babies and kill those who try and take the babies from them. They soon began playing up to the legend, bringing their babies and younger siblings on watch to scare of the humans of ‘The Outer Earth’ out of the area.","tags":["YukiOnna","cute","mythology","anime","manga","icon","blink"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmRWaW5VXzELnD6pZe4HMxpPZV8Dh4iVyvnQgwFEMfqN5K","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRWaW5VXzELnD6pZe4HMxpPZV8Dh4iVyvnQgwFEMfqN5K","display_uri":"ipfs://QmYmyGzv5q86rAZ2WR6WWaWnzTwTpcrZfF9upT5Do4iMfR","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

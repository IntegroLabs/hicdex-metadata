The tree will be planted and named after this fractal and youâ€˜ll get to follow the process and watch it grow.  All proceeds will be used to plant trees through Eden Reforestation Projects. My personal goal is to plant one million trees!  The fern code developed by Barnsley is an example of an iterated function system to create a fractal. He has used fractals to model a diverse range of phenomena in science and technology, but most specifically plant structures. This is a tribute and homage to him.

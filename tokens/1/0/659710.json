Why I am here?\nWell, I was lost in an alley full of old shops nearby Osaka.\n\nI accidentally saw a weird old ramen shop. So I was just glancing at a menu. It was ramen with the black soup which I've never tried before. Because of hunger and my weird thought, I then got in and try such black ramen even though I cannot read any Japanese.\n\nSurprisingly, it was such a weird ramen shop!! with an octopus chef !? His 8 tentacles were moving so fast. All the Fish Head customers were insanely eating and slurping the black ramen, unlike a human (Well, they're not a human though).\n\nBut wait, is the black soup was made of ink from the chef himself???\n\nShould I try it?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTTo6rEMPtyDtdPvxwT7VEJu8tNqeVJKMbg2vx6hxdYAn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSCmrX83ScQw99gzXqhetrt7gLghzF74nXpCRMPr54Qbv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTTo6rEMPtyDtdPvxwT7VEJu8tNqeVJKMbg2vx6hxdYAn", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QcYBk6dGYq9y4cyKUX8etdyouEZi9c27a"], "tags": ["animation", "2d", "watercolor", "illustration", "color", "traditional", "anime", ""], "extra": {}}

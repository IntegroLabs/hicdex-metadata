Think of the whole piece as an album, and each fragment as a song ;)\n\nA visual diary that takes you on a walk with me through a city called Curitiba, in the south of Brasil. I was on summer vacation, spent most of my days smoking joints and wandering through the neighborhood. A lot goes on my mind when I see these images but I can't say it here.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CL2v3WKBLE4/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVK1gHwE5x77gWDjmu8Gn6E7oVKrXBySMiUDo1YM3VkQz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfFaCarWwy3pGmGJEXgUBCBpxEZbW18mfnZFmepETuttD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVK1gHwE5x77gWDjmu8Gn6E7oVKrXBySMiUDo1YM3VkQz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PtvQ8NA2ZAazJR351GSjvJ6GUcRTwn8Zs"], "tags": ["photography", "streetphotography", "fotografia", "colagem", "collage", "diary", "journal", "diario", "brasil", "brazil", "dxxx", "streetart", "art", "arte", "graffiti", "pixo", "cwb", "curitiba"], "extra": {}}

It's like seeing an old friend and some time has passed presenting a slightly more mature version of the person you knew years ago. In AN ONION OF SKINS, we find ourselves observing the words in a cascade of orange and purple; a micro quote of what Alan Watts described as \"to find out that the ego is indeed a fake...you will see that the ego IS exactly what IT pretends IT isn't.\". We peel the skins of our egos away like layers of onions to reveal nothing inside. It's all made up; everything is made up! As stated on previous pages, you make up who you are. Your story is just that, a story. The best thing is that you are not that story. You're alive and you're amazing! Don't let stories that lie in your mind (pun intended) define who you currently are. The past is the past and the future is unwritten, do something different or unexpected; surprise yourself.

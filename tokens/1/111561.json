The original has been transferred to this state by form of replacement/reinstallation/destruction. The black components are necessary for the brain to reassociate with the replaced memory, thus over-writing the former. They also act as a validation/credibility\u00a0checker with the transferred\u00a0memory; a form of mental proof via differentiation. This NFT over time will become a stronger memory in this digital landscape, than the internal one of it's original occupier.

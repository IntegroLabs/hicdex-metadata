He is the son of Bathala (the supreme deity of the Tagalogs) and the patron of all fighters and warriors. It is said that when Bathala went into a deep slumber, Apolaki fought his sister Mayari (the goddess of the Moon) for dominion over the Earth. Their battle resulted in a truce after Apolaki blinded Mayari in one eye. And so they decided to divide their rule, with Mayari ruling the night and Apolaki ruling the day.","tags":["apolaki","sungod","sun","god","aswang","cryptid","monster","creature","mythology","myth","philippines","filipino","pinoy","black","dark","illustration","digital"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmRV83vTPWFvdKdBbBFFjyiha748vc278mWsmw3ASrnvCp","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRV83vTPWFvdKdBbBFFjyiha748vc278mWsmw3ASrnvCp","display_uri":"ipfs://QmepJJbuKkoMYza9AGbG3c8sPhHaytwEyzLFeuaVNMGat3","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

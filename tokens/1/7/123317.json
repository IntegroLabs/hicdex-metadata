{"name": "Apolaki", "description": "Apolaki is the god of War and the Sun. He is the son of Bathala (the supreme deity of the Tagalogs) and the patron of all fighters and warriors. It is said that when Bathala went into a deep slumber, Apolaki fought his sister Mayari (the goddess of the Moon) for dominion over the Earth. Their battle resulted in a truce after Apolaki blinded Mayari in one eye. And so they decided to divide their rule, with Mayari ruling the night and Apolaki ruling the day.", "tags": ["apolaki", "sungod", "sun", "god", "aswang", "cryptid", "monster", "creature", "mythology", "myth", "philippines", "filipino", "pinoy", "black", "dark", "illustration", "digital"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmRV83vTPWFvdKdBbBFFjyiha748vc278mWsmw3ASrnvCp", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmepJJbuKkoMYza9AGbG3c8sPhHaytwEyzLFeuaVNMGat3", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1Q3dc9cujebXdjjRuczGegfZsQAbTHEEML"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRV83vTPWFvdKdBbBFFjyiha748vc278mWsmw3ASrnvCp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

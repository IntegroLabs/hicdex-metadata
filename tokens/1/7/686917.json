{"__version": 1, "token_id": 686917, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "THIS IS HIS HISTORY OR", "description": "Patterns are all around us, especially in language. In THIS IS HIS HISTORY OR we see an amalgamation of THIS and HISTORY that creates the jumbled word of THISTORY. From this one fusion we can create a new narrative that gives the work its weight. In addition to this union, we notice that the entire \"canvas\" has the title of the poem/narrative that repeats over and over and over again. Reason why this was done was to imbue the work with properties that allow you the reader, actually begin the narrative wherever you want. Though the title is THIS IS HIS HISTORY OR, you can actually create your own starting point. The sentence seems to go on forever no matter where you start...no beginning and no end; an infinity of sorts, stuck inside forever. Also, you'll notice that in the center, all the extra letters that aren't used are hidden from sight, but to the left and the right of center we can clearly see all the extra letters that are not used. This was done on purpose to expose the richness of color and ensure the over concept of a pattern...like an endless tapestry.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbssLHDkbAEfABMDoSH41rMRugSLM3m3fDz99EAKtha3J", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUsSTXRJYfr3bHWW9Y4zr2539xy2gLHPyxGaRXBcY8CsN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbssLHDkbAEfABMDoSH41rMRugSLM3m3fDz99EAKtha3J", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

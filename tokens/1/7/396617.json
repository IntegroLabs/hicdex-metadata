{"__version": 1, "token_id": 396617, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "TURNING 40", "description": "My mother told me on my 40th birthday on February 13th, 2017, that life begins at 40. She was not wrong one bit. Since then, I've had plenty of time to think about what life in my 40s was going to be about. I've come to realize that turning 40 is like adding a comma to a sentence. What in the name of similes does that mean? Let's break it down. Most sentences has a subjects and predicates. The main difference between the subject and the predicate is their function; the subject informs us what or who the sentence is about whereas the predicate describes the action performed by the subject. Still with me? So now let's give life to this sentence. No really, let's make believe that the sentence \"TURNING 40, IS LIKE ADDING A COMMA TO A SENTENCE.\" is actually alive. I know its ridiculous, this is conceptual art; theater of the mind. We can separate our lives into two parts pre-midlife and post-midlife. The period represents death; the finality of the end of the sentence. The comma represents an inflection point, turning 40 or midlife. Notice that the subject is shorter than the predicate, insinuating and playing on the text's premise that life begins after that comma. By using that comma, we can use the predicate here to give perspective to the subject.

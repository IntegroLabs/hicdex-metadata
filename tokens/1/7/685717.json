{"__version": 1, "token_id": 685717, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Delilah", "description": "In its most general symbolism, hair is an energetic manifestation, in that it is seen as an expression of the body's strength that emerges from nothing more and nothing less than the head, symbol of the power of the spirit. Perhaps the myth that most fully accounts for this meaning is the story of Samson and Delilah recounted in the Old Testament. In it, Samson performs multiple feats that show his enormous physical strength. However, Delilah discovers that this power resides in his scalp and cuts it off, making Samson a weak and vulnerable man. \nThe opulent hair is considered to represent vital energy and the joy of living, and is related to freedom. \n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRxj6sP6mLNZEWyYJyUT58zKgTCqRSbnhFzgKaJKbCn2c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaKMiBvgyqdnKcZ1zf227JDNUz5eJwE3zMzJB1rrZYMe3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRxj6sP6mLNZEWyYJyUT58zKgTCqRSbnhFzgKaJKbCn2c", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz29qUQenz4uJx1nyHopjZQANDneM5jSA1fj"], "tags": ["illustration", "erotic", "symbolism", "hair", "arwork", "artproject"], "extra": {}}

I have exhibited many times over my career through solo exhibitions and group ones. My latest work, that has not yet been exhibited, is a combination of old hand made drawings combined with my latest digital skills. As an artists I see my future turning more in this direction because of the actual result, result that only concerns the quality of the artwork.

The Japanese believe that the crane is a sacred creature that can give long life and healing. It is said that if people are able to make 1000 paper birds (Senbazuru) it is considered to be able to provide healing for sick people.\n\nThis work is inspired by the story of Sadako Sasaki, a woman who struggles with leukemia. She was determined to make 1000 paper birds so that he could recover. However, before completing the 1,000 paper birds, Sadako died and was only able to complete about 644 origami cranes. As a tribute, his friends and loved ones continued her dream of making 1,000 paper cranes. Then they included Senbazuru together at her funeral.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUSs9kcN3URQd9UZkoCJtRm5vr6rjzANtajThXtTgw4WV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbGFL3K9JuX4qRhhBUbhyAJYRmRBfSDZgJ64gerDyTZyd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmYAmhifdoztbN9zzQ7LV9zsZDp2pTnu2CvFPtgdcVPcsC", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUSs9kcN3URQd9UZkoCJtRm5vr6rjzANtajThXtTgw4WV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Ac42Zn368R9Xxbscsu1cfmS4wSSmrdjfk"], "tags": ["senbazuru", "senbatsuru", "paperbird", "papercrane", "japanstory", "girl", "colorfull"], "extra": {}}

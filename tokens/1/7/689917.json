Garnets are commonly red but also come in an extraordinary range of beautiful colors, including orange, yellow, purple and vibrant green. There are even garnets that change color from blue to purple in different lighting. Some believe the true value of the garnet birthstone is its power to bring the wearer good health, wealth and happiness.\n\nThe name \u201cgarnet\u201d originates from the medieval Latin granatus, meaning \u201cpomegranate,\u201d in reference to the similarity of the red color. Garnets have been used since the Bronze Age as gemstones and abrasives. Necklaces studded with red garnets adorned the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Signet rings in ancient Rome featured garnet intaglios that were used to stamp the wax that secured important documents. The clergy and nobility of the Middle Ages had a preference for red garnets.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWBQCfbJmuiuTpUHgaC45g8v5i3HYgU6VSRfrDSuj6Q56", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUg4xvtpDETfBtqYR36WWiATGVhoEpWgyc36hrjpwvEyo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWBQCfbJmuiuTpUHgaC45g8v5i3HYgU6VSRfrDSuj6Q56", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PfAdqpcgXmb6X1RFtxWr1KcJpUfkR9yHR"], "tags": ["JANUARY", "GARNET", "BIRTHSTONE", "SEVEN", "BATTLES", "2", "7", "ART", "ARTIST", "PAINT", "PAINTING", "FIGURE", "HUMAN"], "extra": {}}

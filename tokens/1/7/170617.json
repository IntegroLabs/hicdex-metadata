This ship (currently referring to as Fortune) went through a bunch iterations and I settled on this wavy design cuz it makes my eyes happy. I wasn't thinking too much about line tension so the ropes holding the spinnaker have a curve to them, which was originally supposed to mimic the curves of the wind and clouds. @Slephy2 is ma twitter.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSAthHKaJ4KFtHfGXrTD96GesbomAdRyyyJjaxSZTcnGu", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc8h9adqu8zDQMXcvAyY4s5dhGfGGeESuJ7sVarwVCF3i", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSAthHKaJ4KFtHfGXrTD96GesbomAdRyyyJjaxSZTcnGu", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hERUjxadCQscusXhW1v2b8snFPUyaUejB"], "tags": ["breeze", "sunset", "freedom", "clouds", "sky", "air", "fortune", "wind", "concept", "sailing"], "extra": {}}

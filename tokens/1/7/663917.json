Besides art, I like to write poetry and play the piano. My art seeks to capture the simultaneously symbiotic and tense relationship between order and chaos. Creation and destruction, are simultaneously flip sides of a coin and the same thing. In art, as in life, I seek encounters with what we most love and what we most fear.\n\nThanks for checking out my art, hope you have a great day.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYqLSNmgTivR3vesuxsFCFjJidkd2CW4eAiT7TfdGiWeU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXAA6YscXS5y84wSSB5RzypQNHHPBxQ539EMcrKEZbNJq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYqLSNmgTivR3vesuxsFCFjJidkd2CW4eAiT7TfdGiWeU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NtLeXgpZQbWsMTMsECahg6oR88tU7iCTq"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "abstract", "beautiful", "color", "colors", "expressionism", "chaoticexpressionism", "abstractexpressionism", "love", "chaoticneutral", "brightcolors"], "extra": {}}

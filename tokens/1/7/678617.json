If we think about time as a complex system we will find out it is not only unpredictable, but not necessarily linear. Every time we look at the sky we could be envisioning the past in the brightness of thousands of stars that have been dead for centuries. Any change in a system modifies the whole that contains it and the progressive accumulation of these variables generates new realities. The collection Dead Constellations explores these possibilities. Through multiple brushstrokes, layers and textures, non-linear paths are generated, paths that break and generate new realities. \"We are stardust\" Carl Sagan", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmREkLexcXyQdoxY3xw9cjJrT2y4amXo14Cipt1qZ5sZvo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQpPNVFgUnnFgs7iDvpTM5KhHWxNttR59GfLeD4Dpfz2J", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmREkLexcXyQdoxY3xw9cjJrT2y4amXo14Cipt1qZ5sZvo", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1c8YasoAkyTLW9R3nL85bMmPvWsFhbbbE2"], "tags": ["abstract", "painting", "drawing", "digital", "art"], "extra": {}}

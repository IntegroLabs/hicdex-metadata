The nodes involved are not required to know each other's identity or trust each other. In fact, to ensure consistency between the various copies, the addition of a new block is globally governed by a shared protocol. Once the addition of the new block has been authorized, each node updates its own private copy: the very nature of the data structure guarantees the absence of its future manipulation.","tags":["#CRYPTOART#SURREALISM#BLOCKCHAIN.001#DIGITAL#I.A."],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmQgmBRVHGqxKnJsBfjAas4RH6JedDqWRsqyPP2t88TXhS"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQgmBRVHGqxKnJsBfjAas4RH6JedDqWRsqyPP2t88TXhS","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXjxQYYiSAWvgatE34HhLJ1a32edUZgJMi64Djz6qzShu","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

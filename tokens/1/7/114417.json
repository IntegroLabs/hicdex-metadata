The nodes involved are not required to know each other's identity or trust each other. In fact, to ensure consistency between the various copies, the addition of a new block is globally governed by a shared protocol. Once the addition of the new block has been authorized, each node updates its own private copy: the very nature of the data structure guarantees the absence of its future manipulation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQgmBRVHGqxKnJsBfjAas4RH6JedDqWRsqyPP2t88TXhS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXjxQYYiSAWvgatE34HhLJ1a32edUZgJMi64Djz6qzShu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": [ "tz1LM5jfAP6KLeS5z8WivY9od9ornH8DskgF" ], "tags": [ "#CRYPTOART#SURREALISM#BLOCKCHAIN.001#DIGITAL#I.A." ], "formats": [ { "mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmQgmBRVHGqxKnJsBfjAas4RH6JedDqWRsqyPP2t88TXhS" } ], "token_info": { "@@empty": "ipfs://QmQBShiQ4Rcu1JShRqEhGzqhkUotmeKiBLkZ89fEaTirsd" }, "supply": "1" }

It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.  Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\" ― Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto","tags":["animation","communistmanifesto","marx","abstract"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmXavsV38qRXDZCtccVYL5QGM6onvJ55VhH24rMS52pVwE","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXavsV38qRXDZCtccVYL5QGM6onvJ55VhH24rMS52pVwE","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXavsV38qRXDZCtccVYL5QGM6onvJ55VhH24rMS52pVwE","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

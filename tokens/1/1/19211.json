This piece is a 1920 by 1080 grid of pixels whose colors have been individually manipulated through a sixteen-times-repeated application of a specific RGB filter function. After this many applications of the function, a series of self-similar geometries begin to emerge. From this piece I have created 10 different variants which will subsequently be minted as single-edition NFTs and listed for sale at a price of 1.0 XTZ each.","tags":[],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmZEQ4pSQaJEpFi6t7iktAVykWKJqh7mw3mgNehWZwRtbR"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZEQ4pSQaJEpFi6t7iktAVykWKJqh7mw3mgNehWZwRtbR","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbPtHdCxuKbCsfQB4LMxZzTCKpNMpQ1AEMCBVUudkod7H","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

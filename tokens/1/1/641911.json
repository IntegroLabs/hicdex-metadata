This person is the human embodiment of the colour blue: intense, a little sad, but with a calmness to them. \nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmeu5RYJsx6e397FqTRj9MLuDLgp5dmWYRHM2EQfpSUPmJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmeu5RYJsx6e397FqTRj9MLuDLgp5dmWYRHM2EQfpSUPmJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmeu5RYJsx6e397FqTRj9MLuDLgp5dmWYRHM2EQfpSUPmJ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours", "blue"], "extra": {}}

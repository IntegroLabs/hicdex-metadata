{"__version": 1, "token_id": 641211, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "HEARTBEATS", "description": "HEARTBEATS, is another example of a static syntax crystal with dual word pyramids built within it. Dual word pyramids aren't anything new to us as we journey along this long and winding path towards wisdom and knowledge, but they sure do show us some of the wild structures and lattices within the language. One of the unique things about HEARTBEATS is that the shapes of these word pyramids create peaks and valleys and within these forms we can see a heartbeat within HEARTBEATS. It's interesting to see how the narratives pop right out of the work and how sometimes they're hidden within them. I've been adapting my mind to locate and discover these and other rarities. One of the most difficult things to do in this kind of work would be to say I'm looking \"X\" and I'm going to find it now. Doing this type of work requires: 1. A completely open mind. 2. A willingness to let words/phrases/concepts find you. 3. A desire to feel like you're in the middle of the ocean on a raft with a sail waiting for the wind. 4. Probably being on the autism spectrum would help a lot.

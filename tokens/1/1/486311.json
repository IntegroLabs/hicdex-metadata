THIS IS ME DATING.", "description": "I remember on a cannabis infused visionquest, I was meditating on the word meditating in a meta kind of way. Sometimes the words come to me, sometimes I choose a topic and ponder the entire concept from beginning to end. I'll do research to attempt to fully grasp a subject and then begin to reduce it to its essence. This time I imagined certain letters slowly disappearing and forming totally new sentences, new contexts, and new meanings. When I combined the sentences together the result is what you see here. This is how I meditate and mediate my life; through thorough thought. Dating and being in love with a person like me isn't easy and I acknowledge that. (Thank you Teddy for loving me.) Introverts tend to shy away from social gatherings and/or conversations, instead some focus on their craft, their inner voice. I search for the esoteric, the strange, the unknown, and the truth about truth.

Not forever, of course. But for a certain time when you feel free and independent. It gives us the frame to be creative and to try out new things.When we were on the Kermovan peninsula, we fell victim to the beauty of nature once again.

It heals, it stays.","tags":["photography","blackandwhite","35mm","canon","portrait","france","fern"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmexz6W1t7LMbm6EfkfPiP5SWqtfQSc8GPq3Cu7n4UQZi7"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmexz6W1t7LMbm6EfkfPiP5SWqtfQSc8GPq3Cu7n4UQZi7","display_uri":"ipfs://QmSmSvuAHsa9qJ5K2UEu2iRr2xS1thxhYmEHhizihYQoBE","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

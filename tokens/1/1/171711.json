Mostly these stories relate to inner processes and to attempts to make meaning of the events and occurances around us. Different beings represent different inner powers/aspects or archetypes that occur in different ways in various mythologies of the world. In this way there is a sense of both completely unique, personal experinece and story, but at the same time a universality of experience of being human that is often brought out by stories, myths, legends in which we find meaning and recognition accross cultures. \nThe work itself is a composition and digital reflection of analog drawings, where further digital illustration is performed. In order to obtain the hybrid feel, the illustration retains both the grit and style of analog and the clean line of the digital.

To capture this picture I used my phone's camera set to pro mode so that I could control basic parameters. Everything was in shadow except from certain areas due to the above foliage. This plant in particular was in the focus of light, but I wanted to focus on it even more. I used the following parameters: F1,8 | 1/750 s | 5,23mm | ISO 200. The picture curiously turned out BW in the brigther areas. Maybe this is a common phenomenon, well known by pro photographers, but for me it's been the first time. I could have edited the photo some way but didn't want to ruin the magic that naturally happened. I didn't even change the file name so that everything stayed intact.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQaJGCrgeueSmGU1eyrKAgki1FDz8s6aNpc2nWGAEa6nQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUL36qHU2T1QVJe9Yie6ZAnHm4MMbFRmiEYmnxsGfTHUt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQaJGCrgeueSmGU1eyrKAgki1FDz8s6aNpc2nWGAEa6nQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LWnEVnnJHD8Qfp2BUTSVEmV4oyJfSW8MK"], "tags": ["laminum", "album", "nettle", "green", "BW", "black", "white", "black&white", "plant", "woods", "focuslight", "shading"], "extra": {}}

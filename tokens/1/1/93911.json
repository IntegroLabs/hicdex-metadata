The film is attributed to the novel called ‘’The Wild Boys’’ by William S. Burroughs and is based on a passage that we hear him reading with his own voice. I came across this recording by chance and wanted to turn it into another art piece to show my appreciation of this great writer.","tags":["videoart","video-art","Burroughs","experimental","black&white","satire","toy","wildboys","Avantgarde","noir"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmapegyLguciya1aKKrt9grDTJC7kBH4LSFcTSB6Uhszvx"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmapegyLguciya1aKKrt9grDTJC7kBH4LSFcTSB6Uhszvx","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

I was looking for a deer picture and found out the news about a siamese twin deer. It\u2019s interesting, I thought, so I opened it up.\n\nI didn\u2019t read the news, the picture was the only thing that intrigued me. Two head in a body and they just lay dead. Breathless.\n\nI was wondering the details that leads them to the died. Was it because they had to share a body? Was it had conflicted interest? Or were they hate each other to the point they wanted to be separated?\n\nI wish I know, but they can\u2019t speak and dead and they are far away I assume. Just like we do, we are limited by how we are communicate and we might be gone faster than a blink.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTRBPAXUWeP6io6ksrFzEFrKVC6qC9UPUpbx955hkAPbj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSqPiHKd8AfhBwB6qXXtfPspmUFDEzUH7bhcGYCoG8C3R", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTRBPAXUWeP6io6ksrFzEFrKVC6qC9UPUpbx955hkAPbj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1T1zT77dM9RnnMS2s8zEQEpF6RL96hVFNo"], "tags": ["illustration", "watercolor", "deer", "dear", "dead", "roadkill"], "extra": {}}

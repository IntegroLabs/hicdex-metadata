The cover was created by  Storm Thorgerson, following keyboardist Richard Wrightâ€™s suggestion for a classy, bold design. My older brother was a huge Pink Floyd fan so I was always intrigued by their music. I would sneak into his bedroom, a strict no-Jon zone, to dub his collection on to tape. I fell in love with this album. Listening to it now is like bathing in a vat of warm tea.","tags":[""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmYUPoaNmS6fXF8PVYk1nhstEza3TcSfyrvE2ca72WQmQ2"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYUPoaNmS6fXF8PVYk1nhstEza3TcSfyrvE2ca72WQmQ2","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdCVCdb4t2ihMqgVYcMUwEgqAQDkEHhhqi56KAD8RpgwL","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

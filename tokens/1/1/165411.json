According to Wikipedia...\" In a 2D image a color combination is stored for each picture element (pixel). Additional data for each pixel is stored in the alpha channel with a value ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 means that the pixel is fully transparent and does not provide any coverage information; i.e. there is no occlusion at the image pixel window because the geometry did not overlap this pixel. A value of 1 means that the pixel is fully opaque because the geometry completely overlaps the pixel window.\" Hence the image is fully transparent (\u03b1=0) and the Imagebackground is set black it appears black. \nImage name: ether.png\nImage Size: 1920px x 1080px\ndepth: 32\ndate: 13.06.21\ntime:19:18\nsize:9,54 KB\nattribute: read-only", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSZKqEWc5e6g42XPpdoDLofXHLNjDC1ZsLxd9qgt5LVTv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcdyozjrECv7UTr9EKF5msF7RxQQPJqRGbePM4iJ8KRk8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSZKqEWc5e6g42XPpdoDLofXHLNjDC1ZsLxd9qgt5LVTv", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1RpMM44P5Tj4wSPrxJH9DBf71cmT4nGKQi"], "tags": ["chrispawlowski", "Ether", "transparentart"], "extra": {}}

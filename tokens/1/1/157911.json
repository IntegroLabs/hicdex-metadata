The OBJKT is the first piece of the triptych \u201cGarden of Earthly Delights, Update V.2\u201d and it is based on the contemporary reinterpretation of Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s 16th century masterpiece \u201cGarden of Earthly Delights\u201d. The entire exhibition that the work takes part in was initially the master project of the artist and has been completed in two years and a half. She was visited several times during this period in her studio in Antwerp by a mysterious Renaissance age ghost who whispered to her how to update the Holy Garden into its contemporary state.

With hope and the strength to not give up, holding together though the darkest times. To believe in yourself and keep on pushing. To see the beautiful, the coloful and the light. Being brave to get though the darkness, stand up to keep on going. With all its forms and colors. Take life with all of its lights.","tags":["3D","ABSTRACT","ARTWORK","COLLECTIBLE","SPACE","GALAXY"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmYjro6ZmCdMHXDz6a3x3DpZ8QBBU68AKdYP5hKDTeP5mU"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYjro6ZmCdMHXDz6a3x3DpZ8QBBU68AKdYP5hKDTeP5mU","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

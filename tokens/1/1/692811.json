No. You'll wish you were dead.\nA figure without a form, his eyes cold and forlorn\n\nAs you press your hands to pray, hoping he would go away\nThe Spectre just laughs at you because he knows he's here to stay\nSo when you hear a knock on the door, open it or not\nYou can't ignore him anymore, Brother Dan lives forevermore", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZMTtAMn2i885Jw2C4xKxeFzKiE3Hy3SK5fREsRPxysdw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXbZFN3BQkpFo1qnRYFkpJr4LXmcFxVE5HpdknA88qJZf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZMTtAMn2i885Jw2C4xKxeFzKiE3Hy3SK5fREsRPxysdw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YJXZGU9DQAzj6YyNByCZP7VHRseuj2FkX"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "psychart", "illustration", "horror", "vintage", "pulp", "darkart", "_schizz", "retro"], "extra": {}}

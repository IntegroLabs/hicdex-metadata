Creating Emotional Art having climbed out of my own Dark Well of Toxic abuse.\n\nA collection of images conveying my story of a painful journey through Clinical Depression & Narcissistic Abuse. \n\nThis piece is entitled  \u2018Inside a Poisoned Mind\u2019\u2019 and tells of how incredibly Trapped you can feel in an Abusive Relationship or within your own mind when suffering Depression.\n\nIf you have or are still stuck in a Toxic or Mentally Abusive Relationship, you will know only too well how increasingly difficult over time it becomes to \u2018escape\u2019. I understand this very well indeed and I want you to know that you Can get Free and you Are very much appreciated and Loved by those who really DO Care for you, even if your abuser has managed to seemingly crow-bar those closest to you out of your life.\n\nIt won\u2019t be forever - You CAN leave and you Should Leave.\n\nI do hope you connect with my art. It's very important to me to convey the message that there Is Hope if you are suffering yourself with Depression, Anxiety or a Toxic, Abusive Relationship - The other side of a dark decision is much brighter and remember it can be - once you get the mental strength once again - just literally through that doorway . . \n\nBe Strong | Ask for Help | Be You | Don\u2019t let Anyone Control You | Love Your Existence because it\u2019s the Only one you will get and it is very precious and once turned, it can be the most beautiful existence you will ever experience.\n\nMuch love to you all - Skarraquin x\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRU5Lkng7uhD6zerkoUahR3CPNjLhkTwVGqeoPjx993TH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmekPgHyWFBW2GQp1NWwMqPhUEaycAbQ2ShmuVzcAhwdHY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRU5Lkng7uhD6zerkoUahR3CPNjLhkTwVGqeoPjx993TH", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SMqwfeGbjMTsvfCEF4k6iCxKkHBeWL56a"], "tags": ["vqgan+clip", "aicollab", "digitalart", "aiart", "narcissism", "mentalhealth", "depressionrecovery"], "extra": {}}

The possible combinations are endless. 16 element types are constantly being recombined in terms of color, position and size. The works of The Unknown Portraits Series are digital drawings or paintings in which the artist addresses the \"portraits\" in the digital age - it's about avatars and profile pictures, face recognition and the handling of personal rights in today's world.

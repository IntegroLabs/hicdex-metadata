Quite a mouthful! It's a way to apply some sound synthesis ideas to a kind of image synthesis that is often used in ML applications, but is used here to make abstractions.","tags":["GIF","gradient","WIP","experimental","loop"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmUC3CpReuNhW9x88b71D9HY9U1HNXvFpueAZxZzbJ3V8m"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUC3CpReuNhW9x88b71D9HY9U1HNXvFpueAZxZzbJ3V8m","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

She loves unicorns so I made her an art piece that would lift her spirits during this difficult time in her life. The orange ribbon is used to represent leukemia awareness. Among her friends and family she is affectionately called \"Bailey Bird\". I imagined a blue bird flitting around a unicorn and the unicorn playing with the bird. This became how I wanted to represent my friend \"Bailey Bird\". I hope you enjoy this artwork and think about how precious life is!","tags":["unicorn","horse","bird","bluebird","fantasy","animals","scene","scenery","anime","fun","happy"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmSS924hLqnXFafg9BvB4atBc91twyi4tc4Dbwba72nE1M"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSS924hLqnXFafg9BvB4atBc91twyi4tc4Dbwba72nE1M","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

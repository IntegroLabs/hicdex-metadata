The images evoke liminal spaces, uncanny biomes, surreal and extra-dimensional lands.  These images are actual photographs, not digital renders. They depict real environments. The photos play with the idea that it takes very little to radically shift our perceptions, and that it is worth exploring this phenomenon.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXuzmyQHvSnbKdzAEob3d7tC7wKeDjB1zU1efmBAFH9zv","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1UivLxfD9EYH5UzGJgzFtn54r7TWia4tbB"],"tags":["photography","nature","abstract","digital","red","yellow","orange","color","photo","ambient","fineart","surreal","alien","liminal"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmXuzmyQHvSnbKdzAEob3d7tC7wKeDjB1zU1efmBAFH9zv"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmWNSkjxgnc7D8YGmvLp6GmFZ5gtXfLRnzXQyb2Lai5X1B"},"supply":"10","transfered":6}

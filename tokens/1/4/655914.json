It's changing from raw emotions and to an almost spiritual outlook. This is the very first appearance of a text mandala. Technically on page 341 we have the first, but that was a word pyramid; this is something completely different. What makes this one unique is that this is the start of one of my favorite types of all wordplay; color puns. Color puns for me tie so many aspects of art together into one perfect package: (1. Balance of composition 2. Contrast 3. Emphasis 4. Movement 5. Pattern 6. Rhythm 7. Unity 8. Limited palette of color / Color theory 9. Minimalism 10. Humor) The mandalas act like a meditation exercise. We focus in on the words and as they twist around we repeat them over and over and over again, becoming a mantra (a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation). When we mix art and mantras together, we get a spiritual portal bypassing the ego and delivered directly to our subconscious mind.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPHkS3s34d9M48wPB5FqL9fZa82BsZB6XMYx6FudGZc7Z", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc3JQ7P55BncL2QQHUc5nBz3XikjGxD3oBe8ATKmzky6m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPHkS3s34d9M48wPB5FqL9fZa82BsZB6XMYx6FudGZc7Z", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

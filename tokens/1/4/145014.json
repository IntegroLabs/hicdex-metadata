But i don't want to take my own life ,i beg you Kazan please end my pathetic life here only . Kazan: your life is in my hand ,now ? Ninja: yes , lord Kazan ! Kazan: listen kid , you got it all wrong ,I am called undefeated ry\u016b not because I have never lost a duel ,or a fight . I have lost atleast a thousand times or so .. but some how i have always managed to survive any fight . And i took that as a sign from the god himself that he wants me to live ,he has just saved my life . For the first time ,when i lost i wanted to end my life too but my sensie said these lines to me, son: if you are still breathing that means the fight isn't over yet. You have just fallen or got a cut stand up . And train harder ,and fight back ! You are alive from God's grace ,don't disrespect it . I never gave up . No matter how many times I have fallen ,If I can breathe that means fight isn't over ,life isn't over ! And today I am what i am because of this attitude . Stand o young Ninja of koga clan ,rise and train harder ,come back later to defeat me some day for real . And when you will do so i will give you this ryuma and will name you the undefeated Okami .", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYmBnVptpjYGxdGihD9DS8AC9BVXyyyrezQXYXjJvacnQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNRWMKQRpr9sPJ9iFjH6gzXbSyztdxAxKGjt3naCFK6Fb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYmBnVptpjYGxdGihD9DS8AC9BVXyyyrezQXYXjJvacnQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TabUj5ot4nRc9po4j13XJx1rRLNco5pVh"], "tags": ["Photoshop", "Art", "Ninja", "Samurai", "Japan", "Moon"], "extra": {}}

This work represents that it can sometimes feel like a curse to have a head overflowing with ideas, impressions and feelings. You don\u2019t always want to live inside of your own head.\nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcJds4oYeTPQmaSGbsygX7kXe2ACZPWKSZy6HdM8oADWz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmToPo4ryuS3VUYiMvgoX2ba4f1DEpDiByNzKytsoDGGnm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcJds4oYeTPQmaSGbsygX7kXe2ACZPWKSZy6HdM8oADWz", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours", "divergence"], "extra": {}}

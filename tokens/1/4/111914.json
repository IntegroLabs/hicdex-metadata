In her rise, the hope of returning to earth.  This land became our treasure today.  The cursed game eventually came to an end, We so quickly forget the value of things, Blind, as if everything was eternal.  We are coming home.\"  Cyril Rolando – Aquasixio x Cédric Rolando – Neoyume  Cyril’s original artwork “Calypso” , 3D sculpted and painted by Cédric.  3D textured model, .glb file format.

Through the extreme fragmentation of her body, Seeger consciously plays with the notion of collectability. The collector of this work can now acquire a terrain or fragment of the artist and thus, own her. The material and immaterial identity is crushed, distributed and circulated until it develops a life of its own. The owner also becomes a part of Seeger's terrain.","tags":["1280×720","01:31","Stereo","Edition/3+1AP"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmeKR8ysgzMNBf7u6vs4zPoeXWvSy7a4eAxWyURbpkRvJm"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmeKR8ysgzMNBf7u6vs4zPoeXWvSy7a4eAxWyURbpkRvJm","display_uri":"ipfs://QmcJRmMVi8QAi4cYNf9CqNmT6hdyx6VdWrerrALiP5fJFW","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

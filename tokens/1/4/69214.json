The seed points are those that enter cycles under the orbit function within 16,384 steps. You can actually stare at a point watch it go through its entire cycle (although there are many exclusive cycles, so a single point will not traverse the entire image). The polar distortion for this object is (r^0.999, θ*1.2 φ*0.9). @BruceKnowsHow","tags":["Generative","Abstract","Render","3D","Fractal","Loop","Procedural","Video"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://Qma25uYT5YG6rkNAPdSKuBCFCL4NJkYaDaDnge5zCJNSTf"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qma25uYT5YG6rkNAPdSKuBCFCL4NJkYaDaDnge5zCJNSTf","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

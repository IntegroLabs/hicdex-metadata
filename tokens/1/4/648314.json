The first one is located in the Thousand Islands Province and the other belongs to Manggarai Regency in East Nusa Tenggara Province. The second one is considered recommended for those who are visiting Komodo National Park. The island is famous for its serenity and unspoiled scenery, on which tourists can relax and perform trekking. Not to mention Kelor Island is suitable for a romantic and tranquil honeymoon and family vacations.\n\nKelor Island has many features, including beautiful beaches, mountains, local activities, and a calm sea. On the shorelines, you can even see some local boats and kids. The locals often come to the beach to do many fun activities like swimming, riding boats, running on the beach, and much more. That means water sports become the main activity in Kelor, so tourists need to prepare extra clothes prior to visiting the island. It is because they are likely to get wet when playing on the seashore.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQPZDwnMrJ1178G7AvPQswLf1mTxh9updp8VoB46K8K6F", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdbuPZtqgFvtVZ4b41PYrRcykGnLEJm4u89pYniewfmdF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQPZDwnMrJ1178G7AvPQswLf1mTxh9updp8VoB46K8K6F", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QanVS6UuVLHoto85pwUnGBFnxjPPLvLrV"], "tags": ["island", "nature", "landscape", "sea", "beach", "flores", "komodo", "indonesia", "ranselusang"], "extra": {}}

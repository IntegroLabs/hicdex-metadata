Even so, not in all places in the archipelago this bird is called an owl. In Java, for example, the name of this bird is dar\u00e8s or manuk dar\u00e8s which has no connotation with death or ghosts. In North Sulawesi, owls are known as Manguni.\n\nOwls are known for their large, forward-facing eyes, unlike most other types of birds whose eyes are turned sideways. Together with the sharply bent beak like an eagle's beak and the arrangement of feathers on the head that forms a circular face, the appearance of this owl's \"face\" is impressive and sometimes scary. Moreover, this bird's neck is so flexible that its face can rotate 180 degrees backwards.\n\nGenerally, owls are mottled, brownish or gray with black and white spots. Combined with its behavior that often freezes and does not move much, this bird is not easily seen; as well as when sleeping during the day under the cover of the leaves.\n\nThe owl's tail is generally short, but the wings are large and broad. Its wingspan reaches about three times its body length.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbJua1wAs5hsFsUEUq4nBfBuWr1TrfKbevMDVZeWRU85H", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNtLwFEKiFwxnWtdrbLFFVCRKQD9Nh6fPJvNuP9VP1igD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbJua1wAs5hsFsUEUq4nBfBuWr1TrfKbevMDVZeWRU85H", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YCP3PMW4nEpaghdCiNNMrejPwD9bqYwCS"], "tags": ["hen500k", "owl", "animal", "hadanimal", "girl", "woman", "collectibles", "illustration", "circle", "mask", "cosplay"], "extra": {}}

Released in 1988, \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d is the epitome of conservative white America\u2019s worst nightmare: A group of African-American youth making loud and aggressive music, with lyrics explicitly glamorizing gang-violence, drug-culture, and illicit sex acts. To say this album is \u2018controversial\u2019 is an understatement. Back then, NWA was FEARED.

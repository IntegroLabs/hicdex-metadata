In code art it is very important to always experiment with different values or functions, see what happens when you switch a thing or two. So I combined some logarithmic and trigonometric functions, and got an interesting vector field, but then I thought, what if I only set a white color for all the particles that have mainly horizontal acceleration. And as we see, this was created.

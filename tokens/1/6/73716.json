Crafted by SalaCorp workers from scraps of stone, blood stained rags and stuffed with the hair of those poisoned by fumes from the mine, these voodoo dolls took on a life of their own, skin hardening to stone as they consumed the souls of dying SalaCorp workers.

This is my 2nd NFT in the steampunk collection.","tags":["digitalart","artefact","magic","fantasy","scifi","steampunk","surreal"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmX7UiUMGYcfV4fZgbgGWTkWLcVyaRKZAoxaPD7UeKHAYs"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmX7UiUMGYcfV4fZgbgGWTkWLcVyaRKZAoxaPD7UeKHAYs","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

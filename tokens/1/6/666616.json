It combines classic archive footage from the past with original words and then immortalises them both using modern technology: the blockchain. The aim of the video poem project is to examine how old footage can be given new life and context within a new artistic medium.\n\nHow can we use memories of the past, captured on film but long since lapsed into historical archive? Is this footage still relevant? What feelings does it evoke today when paired with original poetry and minted using a new medium? And in answering this question, how do we use and experience our own memories? What can we do with nostalgia? Is it condemned to the past or can it be revitalised through art?\n\nA mingling of past, present and future technology with original words, the nostalgic sensation of the poem harks back to the early days of film, while the medium of NFT looks towards the future. The poem explores how we yearn for the past, even though we know that those days (and the people associated with them) can never return. Time moves slower in winter because we dream of spring times long faded and those dreams, no matter how sweet, will always remain unfulfilled. \n\nThe poem is narrated by its author and each line appears on screen along with the footage.\n \nPoem reads:\n\nWhy time moves slower in winter.\n\nMy heart is a clock\nIn an empty house,\nKeeping time with you\nEven though you\u2019re\nLong gone.\n\nThrough dusty corridors,\nFrost stopped gardens,\nAnd frozen patios\nWhere only memories grow\n\nI think of you\nAnd wait, for days\nLike faded polaroids\nOf a spring time long ago.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWvEU5EpqrfR16Pm4merPPiULq9Yz2jGk8WJ99rs1vovX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYrT9KktPPz5tXvhSfNJWn84NSpfP45FmeXGhn5uMYaAW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWvEU5EpqrfR16Pm4merPPiULq9Yz2jGk8WJ99rs1vovX", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Q2ooX8Uzj8TgQGDfNt513aiFVZA9ABid3"], "tags": ["video", "poem", "poetry", "nostalgia", "love", "literature", "narration", "writing"], "extra": {}}

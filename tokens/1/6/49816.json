Through the continuous interactive flow of sound and image, the auditory sense and the visual sense simultaneously stimulate the neural activities of the senses. The track of perceptual evolution is characterized by the uncertainty of interaction between human, media and machine operation, as well as the changing response of current perception.","tags":["NOISE","FUJUIWANG","AUDIOVISUAL","GENERATIVEART","SOUND"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"application/x-directory","uri":"ipfs://QmYibZYEzB3Xz6xsEq6GxJFwfbPpyyS3MnGkpaF6mURtCX"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYibZYEzB3Xz6xsEq6GxJFwfbPpyyS3MnGkpaF6mURtCX","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZZR8jT94zPUvuXno9PtvSKkxo9hopsZrj9SYY55RwNB2","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

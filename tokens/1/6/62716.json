Color saturation with black works similarly on paper and screens, thus facilitating a perception that is almost equal between a live and digital spectator.   Referencing Sol LeWitt, this particular piece comes with a set of instructions in order to re-translate it into a physical object. The piece is then meant to be exhibited both ways.","tags":["drawing","conceptual","analogue","digital","blackandwhite","simple","minimalism","collaboration","meta","morph"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmQy91JqELCq1VgqgLzjfjxZvv8b3kGBFsgLiRYDhQ1F9T"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQy91JqELCq1VgqgLzjfjxZvv8b3kGBFsgLiRYDhQ1F9T","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

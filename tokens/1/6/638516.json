DINNER NERD has an immense internal structure that repeats a several times over, which as a consequence of this rotation, the center is densely layered and a circle has appeared. What is a DINNER NERD? It's an absurdity that illustrates the main purpose of these crystals; structure, balance, and possibility. How far can these crystals be formed? What are some underlying variables that can be played with in regards that can pushed? Can the crystals take on other rock, mineral, stone, gem like formations? Does this constitute as a syntax crystal mandala; a mantra to absurdity?

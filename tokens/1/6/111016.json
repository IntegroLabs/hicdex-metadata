Google had just made the DeepDream algorithm open source and this rendering was accomplished on July 9th, 2015 using virtualbox and boot2docker software. The image was rendered through the DeepDream neural net several times to produce increasingly hallucinogenic results, which were then combined into a looping graphic using Premiere Pro.  Original photography and deep dream rendering done by FPW. July 9th, 2015. Kyoto, Japan.","tags":["#deepdream","#NeuralNetwork","#loop","#dream","#surreal","#psychadelic","#algorithm","#animals","#deer"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmPfNHbA6x1gduUpuSSF2ZJPXgYrq49KTMJwiY66GoRkre"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPfNHbA6x1gduUpuSSF2ZJPXgYrq49KTMJwiY66GoRkre","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVfX1BtVwfhe2aXDY32YgNEULvpgBXo8cM5KbM3LrSZ33","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

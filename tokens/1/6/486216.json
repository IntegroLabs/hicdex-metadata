I hope that if you are watching this from somewhere else in the world that at least it's an interesting example of one of the few CLIP guided diffusion videos in existence..", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ1zXLKe4hTvq6JkAHcuVxHMycAxKgRrCqEdn8p2TceWt", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcy89iiMEYaS56dGj2wxRXLwrkjs4Z8CmXoobuLMDmJRj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ1zXLKe4hTvq6JkAHcuVxHMycAxKgRrCqEdn8p2TceWt", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LwHHzSP3oX4Lwpf2oPD52tViuxGCjCZQv"], "tags": ["henhalloween", "hictober", "end_time", "memento_mori", "snakepit", "gan", "clip", "abstract", "horror", "halloween"], "extra": {}}

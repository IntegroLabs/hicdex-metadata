Each piece in the series created by Graffito has a different starting point and then explodes to fill the screen with overlapping patterns and colours. The core of Graffito is a set of randomly generated curves connecting points along a straight line. Each point is then animated by a randomly assigned trajectory. As the points move, the curves that join them weave and interact, creating these unique generative patterns.  \u00a0 Presented here are 6 unique single-edition pieces generated by the Graffito algorithm.

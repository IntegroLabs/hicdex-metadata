The displayed waveform can then be analyzed for properties such as amplitude, frequency, rise time, time interval, distortion, and others.","tags":["Opsylloscope","Oscilloscope"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmRAzh76qBcJrXVXJKLKUuh5dNHrEpPVt1zsHgLYpzJfjh","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRAzh76qBcJrXVXJKLKUuh5dNHrEpPVt1zsHgLYpzJfjh","display_uri":"ipfs://QmRAzh76qBcJrXVXJKLKUuh5dNHrEpPVt1zsHgLYpzJfjh","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

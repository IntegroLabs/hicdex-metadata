Even though this couple is in human form, they are actually the incarnation of a pair of gods and angels, namely the incarnations of Bathara Wisnu and Dewi Widowati. The climax in this story is when Shinta is kidnapped by Prabu Dasamuka (Rahwana), King Alenka. 10 years Shinta was detained, seduced and tempted to marry. Rama sends the ring via anoman (ape man) and after that tries to pick up Shinta back. He succeeded but he doubted Shinta's chastity. To prove it, Shinta must be burned alive. Turns out, he was still alive. Remain pure as Rama who maintains his holiness even though he has been separated from his wife for a long time.

Here is my interpretation of the character. I tried to stay within the archetype of an aristocrat from Eastern Europe, eaten by time, but without being just a renewed version of Nosferatu made by Murnau. I particularly like the weird Mr. Burns (Simpsons) feel he conveys.","tags":["vampire","nosferatu","portrait","3d","illustration","creature","night","Murnau","classic","monster","Movie","decrepit"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmRMNHb2oMF24DpCfwsdiPEujP8N6barMhMGgmg2YXFanY"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRMNHb2oMF24DpCfwsdiPEujP8N6barMhMGgmg2YXFanY","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNxxnXbFm4gpCQsbGUcqD9eqwyTZzMxREpDVTfNiFTKLr","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

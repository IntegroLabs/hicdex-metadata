These particles are the unpredictable result of a low-resolution process of photogrammetry, a method that renders 3D models by overlapping photographs of objects. Foraging through the marginal residues of the softwareâ€™s digital processes, Mora dissected the digital landscapes. Wherever glitches surfaces, she meticulously isolated them, enlarged them, and brought them to life, creating a multitude of microorganisms-looking glitches that inhabit a similarly photogrammed landscape.","tags":["3D","digital","worldbuilding","landscape","digitalresidues","glitches","fantasy","nature","photogrammetry"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmYnTBpyXBUBAaU1P3yaJJzdA8yM4nNwub6nNzMYm4EKe9"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYnTBpyXBUBAaU1P3yaJJzdA8yM4nNwub6nNzMYm4EKe9","display_uri":"ipfs://QmRMeW8HAeQGKrWPz3epj4n9WmQvr6tLdqiYdLAP6EdjLE","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

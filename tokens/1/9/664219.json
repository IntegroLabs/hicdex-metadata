Vail helped Morse develop a practical system for sending and receiving coded electrical signals over a wire, which was successfully demonstrated in 1844.\nMorse's telegraph marked the arrival of instant long-distance communication in America. The revolutionary technology excited the public imagination, inspiring predictions that the telegraph would bring about economic prosperity, national unity, and even world peace.\n\nMeasurements\noverall: 3 in x 2 in x 6 3/4 in; 7.62 cm x 5.08 cm x 17.145 cm\n\nExhibition Location\nNational Museum of American History", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRVpCymS2PeuMSsCX72QFMyqFGbp2cjRmDNBHchfw54Z8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXMDCFxN6zsu1Rh9qiHu7rqRJoRSX7s2zh8UZRKAVyiDE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRVpCymS2PeuMSsCX72QFMyqFGbp2cjRmDNBHchfw54Z8", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1Z9ViyeZPU1WMQ4bXRnW2ed7DbZE63pjyB"], "tags": ["key"], "extra": {}}

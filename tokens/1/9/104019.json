The first two pieces, \"Matter\" and \"Essence\" are the question: Are we made of just the atoms that compose our bodies, or if there is something underneath, beyond our touch. \"Persistence\" and \"Ephemeral\" are about the constrast of the infinite and eternal universe, both space and time-wise, against the moment-to-moment experience, composed of stacked presents, one after another, each instant containing the full glory of being alive.

Think again my friends, we're back and this time it's THE FUCHSIA OF ART. Making these are some of the most fun I've ever had making artwork. I understand that for some people those of my previous work can be a bit 'heady', but color puns are always an instant hit because of their directness. I can always count on people reacting positively to these works (for the most part). It's a nice feeling to see people smile and giggle. Sometimes art needs to be serious, candid, and/or direct...and sometimes it should be humorous. Reflection is great and all, but we need to relax once in awhile; got to have moderation.

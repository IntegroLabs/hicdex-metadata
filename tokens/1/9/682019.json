We are definitively declaring that this work is a signed design by the artist in a very meta way. It references itself over and over again. We refer to the artist and then back onto the artwork, which then refers back to the artist and so on and so forth. Simple and right to the point. Often the best solution is the simplest. Direct and to the point; succinct.

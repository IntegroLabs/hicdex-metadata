Heyward Point overlooks the area and affords this view of the sinuous sandspit southeast of the settlement. \n\nI love walking up there; it's high enough that you feel like a bird (or drone?) looking down through flocks of gulls soaring in the uplift from the cliffs to the surf crashing far below, but keeping your feet on the ground. \n\nThis work was created by processing one of my photographs from a walk there with creative coding tools \u2013 specifically vpype flow imager \u2013 to produce flow field line art. It was drawn by an AxiDraw SE/A3 plotter using Pilot Kakuno fountain pens and custom mixed De Atramentis Document inks on Hahnem\u00fchle Stella Matt 250gsm fine art paper.\n\nA primary sale of this NFT entitles the owner to request a physical plot for an additional 120tez (including worldwide shipping). Secondary sales can negotiate the transfer of the physical drawing between themselves.\n\nNFT: 5000x7000px JPG\nPhysical plot: 297x420mm drawing on A2 paper\n\nAramoana, Aotearoa \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff\nPhotographed Jan 23 2022\nProcessed Jan 25 2022\n\njimmykl.tez \nhttps://jimmy.is", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaxuiBGs85Px4XFKCN1U4wCXiwnuXsZoYTzw4hpxoK2pq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUPPm4jhs3rW2LTva6yKgp141oWn7UpBA5pUKd2pSsZjk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmVxdmDsvEqBcDdonNdgo2MzBWgbFUo2iFkQoaLMqjRSXZ", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaxuiBGs85Px4XFKCN1U4wCXiwnuXsZoYTzw4hpxoK2pq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hZ7Q55pbwK26Se2U32iLk57LH4pxGN6VE"], "tags": ["drawing", "plotterart", "landscape", "generativeart", "physical", "plotter", "clouds", "lineart", "python", "flowfield", "physicaldrawing"], "extra": {}}

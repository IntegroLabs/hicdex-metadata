Learning python to script and generate interesting experiences have been an insightful journey so far. I\u2019m fascinated by the thin layer that lives between nature and technology, and I believe that these type of simulations can help us understand better the world around us, at both a microscopic and macroscopic level. The concept of #Emergence in #ProceduralArt in particular is what attracts me the most in this experiment. Discovering lifelike behaviours that makes you question reality. Are algorithms and organisms related? There are many more discoveries to be made on the subject. \n\nStay tuned for my upcoming exhibition focused on the theme of #Microbiomimicry.\n\nPS: Some still renders in the comments section below.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.\n\nOne interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.\n\nThere are 3 simple rules:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdSa1L7unnwXSrLTgnKFrfYwpqMJLYPe2iyY4BeA9dj3H", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVbVotkpaEoEW7zqAzsMFPRWFAhZ9nctVJD9GLFouQcwc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdSa1L7unnwXSrLTgnKFrfYwpqMJLYPe2iyY4BeA9dj3H", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1hbcn3CV8X5kUp4QBmcWCuRLAEJoDqctbp"], "tags": ["JohnConway", "ConwaysGameOfLife", "GenArt", "Genuary", "PythonScripting", "GeometryNodes", "#B3D#GeoNodes#proceduralgeneration#biomimicry#manuvision"], "extra": {}}

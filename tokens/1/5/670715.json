{"__version": 1, "token_id": 670715, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Free", "description": "I created this artwork based on my admiration (as an artist) of how freedom leads to revolution in art.\n\nHere, I drew a man floating in the sky. The man himself is my visualization of artists.\n\nThe man flying shows how free he is. Freedom courages him to explore the world more so his fantasies can bloom and fly to endless ideas on ways it could be expressed (which is represented by the sky).\n\nBy all advantages that exist through freedom, artists get to discover more inspirations from different angle to help their art forms, thus new creations are born. This is why I put halo on the back of his head. This symbolizes that artists are 'god' in their own way. Not only that, the halo also symbolizes how freedom helps illuminate artists mind with fresh concepts. \n\nIn the end, by this art, I want to show my love towards artistic liberty. It opens the gate of new and vast art types and styles that we didn't know exist before. It brings whole new perspectives and expands our universe of imaginations.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSeT4azv3w43CK2e9nKVxiVnMR3eP3uQRtuiDDC9aikbP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQwZvBifjRU3an9MKHEnYzBWjMv9XhKJyfH6UQr8WHgvk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSeT4azv3w43CK2e9nKVxiVnMR3eP3uQRtuiDDC9aikbP", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1a1gSmvnuUtL4jHyurvgPNPgaXepCWaYhU"], "tags": ["digitalart", "digitalillustration", "digitaldrawing", "drawing", "conceptualart", "anime", "illustration", "artisticliberty", "freedom", "free", "liberty"], "extra": {}}

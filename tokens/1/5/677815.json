After The Hengoku Bug reached its peak, many people reacted to it by detaching from reality even more than before. Mono No Aware is a feeling of profound nostalgia related to the beauty of life itself and its constant mutations. Hina Watanabe has developed uncontrollable perceptive powers after the spreading of the \u8fba\u7344 radiations and a feeling of boundless, ecstatic melancholia that lets her feel what the whole the universe is feeling at a specific time. She has become a frequency ghost, tuning to the sound of unperceivable feelings.Traits: Synthwave listener/ Gun Shooter / Playstation Player\nAnimation and original score by Limbo.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZXre8rxmq9ryYkcCWKZu5bFC1j56Zd6p6j7hrqBgF2K7", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma1JZhzv3qGLUBv6DG1wkCygrExi8hJWW7tsxXC8dapTK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZXre8rxmq9ryYkcCWKZu5bFC1j56Zd6p6j7hrqBgF2K7", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iqNoUm1pKBZgw4nWFEeyvFoeqpBme4vVD"], "tags": ["animation", "cyberpunk", "anime", "1990", "limbo", "sountrack", "mp4", "nostalgia", "vaporwave", "synthpop", "hengoku", "limbo", "lives", "again", "against", "infinte", "sadness"], "extra": {}}

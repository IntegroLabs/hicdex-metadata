The flighty behavior of these birds, made the word \"hen\" to be used as fearful. And in Art it is a symbol of vigilance and activity. For this reason it is found in ancient monuments among the attributes of Minerva, Mercury, Asclepius and many others.","tags":["Hen","Eggs","fables","illustration","mare"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmVcNvPa3tvEFozuXxmJTBS5hn4ELmHBS3t33WbKZHQiXN"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVcNvPa3tvEFozuXxmJTBS5hn4ELmHBS3t33WbKZHQiXN","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZeUqXbSzXZELbeMirnccbtkJMD27ubjJeCYNihGqYNGN","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

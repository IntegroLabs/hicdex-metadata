Could be, I don't think it's a coincidence at all in reality. Humans are probably the most successful animal to have every existed on the planet. We have infested just about every square inch of this planet and like colonies of cacophonic cockroaches we multiply where we go and where there is one there's millions of us. Now inherently, humanity isn't bad per se, but boy have we completely screwed up the planet on so many levels. This is both observational and a critique of contemporary human existence. All of us intentionally or unintentionally...one way or another are basically guilty of trashing the planet. Even with our best intentions, we consume products and throw them away. There's got to be a better way for us to exist and harmoniously live on this planet. If we don't figure it out soon, we're going to be in big trouble.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVWzSYMYU8ZTC9wd1Ukt7J83NcSYC9RSmWuimVHJ3i4YY", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma3z7PxkZLTq6JutAFEAVUzCGdE4ZGPhPdScdq3kKpHwY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVWzSYMYU8ZTC9wd1Ukt7J83NcSYC9RSmWuimVHJ3i4YY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

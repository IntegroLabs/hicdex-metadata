{"__version": 1, "token_id": 509015, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Esfera mixta - Festival del Globo", "description": "+ \"Mixed sphere - Balloon Festival\" is a recent edit from the first timelapse i made on 11/19/2017 07:46 a. m. -one of the few also that i've made- and the only timelapse that i worked in a glitch way. \n\nI have attended the Hot Air Balloon Festival in Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato 4 times that i remember right now. Theres usually live music, camping and a lot of sneaking alcohol into the event and hiding while smoking haha > first two years it was a great party with friends... lots of great and funny stories... but the third year was the one that gave us this glitch experiment. \n                                                The hot air balloon takes place early in the morning. 7am there already are balloons in the sky and the first two years that i went i hadnt actually seen the hot air balloon show bec ause i was too hangover to wake up early haha so this time i didnt go to party and actually just went to see the balloons in the morning... with Ivonne. Remember because she was the one who made a timelapse first and i made mine after. Remember more than a couple of attempts, a kid walking by infront of the camera and what i thought was a successful few seconds. \n\nHope you enjoy.

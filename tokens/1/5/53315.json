The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","tags":["ALGORITM","ART","GENERATIVE","RANDOM","GIF"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmcFpNn4iBzgdxiYYd51qH8jQV6vjh2dj4YiNFy8UPZ4AQ"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcFpNn4iBzgdxiYYd51qH8jQV6vjh2dj4YiNFy8UPZ4AQ","display_uri":"ipfs://QmQEy8w1qCwGiz8RVXHwVsygiHjrc7TqzhubFSrqub5iwP","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

In the challenging times we live a flower is a nice antidote to a closed heart in whatever form that takes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ6WT2cHwXhQ67hNSY41m5vjjqXhK6hZFXffhqtguxBx8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQhFgBt1CtEgQGV5ktoynDMSwK5N96kuZnk1fyzYttywR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ6WT2cHwXhQ67hNSY41m5vjjqXhK6hZFXffhqtguxBx8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VQQab8jZvSDdjTn3hpdc6tPsBYPQXGQbi"], "tags": ["Flower", "art", "doodle", "marccraig"], "extra": {}}

This is the physics simulation that resulted in the final shape of the building for New Float.\n\nNew Float is a digital exhibition space in Berlin with a main focus on presenting and discussing current developments linked to NFTs and digital art. I will just use the free property between the Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery), the Philharmonie and St. Mattew\u2019s Church in Berlin until 2026, when the Museum of the 20th Century by Herzog & de Meuron is planned to open. You can enter New Float via www.realworld.art. \n\nThe aim is to create experiences by giving digital art a native and immersive spatial context. New ways of curating will be explored by applying decentralized technologies.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaYBQLMKrsVU3RZEZwmudEf6qVNnH7VNLsXy9syhQeqGR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYgnAzgmhV9ijojez2cQvkUX3bfb4us5UdRjJV2Q4mpFH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaYBQLMKrsVU3RZEZwmudEf6qVNnH7VNLsXy9syhQeqGR", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1T4AcdL2J1ZkY4V6vMre53D9HvCMg4ijAM"], "tags": ["architecture", "video", "rendered", "3d", "manuelrossner", "newfloat", "realworld", "art", "building"], "extra": {}}

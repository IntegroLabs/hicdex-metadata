Australia‚Äôs borders have been shut since March 2020. ‚Ä¢ Stayed awake the entire flight. Music, podcasts, and the inflight display on downward camera. Over ocean, desert, farmland, cities, it was a strange kind of bliss. ‚Ä¢ Flight time is over 800x shorter (~21 hours now only a couple of minutes). Hover/Tap around to explore before you land. ‚Ä¢ @yangwong May 08 2021","tags":["interactive","video","vignette","vignettes","travel","html"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"application/x-directory","uri":"ipfs://QmNYThcDMVTqfhnY3pVTypwomvc3qbieZNvD9KQWXmENiG"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNYThcDMVTqfhnY3pVTypwomvc3qbieZNvD9KQWXmENiG","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbCKrqkhD4UQQKhfq9dGbspWMt5RGdZW5FFRTbxXs3HJD","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

It is both a natural function and an engineered concept that satisfies various social requirements and is filled with certain standards towards the mother and her behavior.\nThe desire to meet the criteria of the ideal, high social expectations and discrimination are strong oppressive factors, pushing the sensory knowledge of the process into the background.

I enjoy being literal and using the very color I'm mentioning when referencing that color. There is a science to CYAN. In the CMYK (a subtractive system) color model, it is one of the main colors, along with magenta, yellow, and black. In the RGB (an additive color system) color model, cyan is equal parts of green and blue light. Fun fact time! It's the complement of red, can be crafted simply by removing red from grey, and if you mix red and cyan light at just the correct intensity we can create white light. Cyan is CYANTIFIC!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQu8hQieGK2yXDjjaDTxSWWMppcpMvdjRpevUSp1fMh4j", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdvBFbo1GyVcNcHKuYMYAGfzjUnLSyoxEPCkmQ7a8FXjR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQu8hQieGK2yXDjjaDTxSWWMppcpMvdjRpevUSp1fMh4j", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

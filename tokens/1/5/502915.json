A casual jogging collective that turned into a nod to make music together. Nood Kink is Gregorius Andika (vocals & guitar), Katarina Drexel (vocals & bass), and Matias Aditya (vocals & guitar).\n\n\"Life is Good (and Nothing You Should Worry About)\" is an epitome for a dull living, which was well-described by one of our dear friends as \"waduh and halah but never astaga.\"\n\nAnxiety, uncertainty, and hardships everlastingly haunt one's wit. Nonetheless, hope and optimism for brighter days to come must remain aflame.\n\nThe single was inspired by a tiresome, humdrum daily routine as a middle-class worker where life may not be difficult, but not that easy anyway.\n\nNothing to worry about, for life is good. Along the path, we found that life is something to be grateful for; yet it is worthy to celebrate along with its twists and turns.\n\n(For those who buy this piece, contact me via Twitter DM, I'll drop a Google Drive link where you can fully listen to our song. Thanks a bunch! Love, Nood Kink <3)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWaqCj14twQ5sEmR5Le1vPZED3W7YQ44hCEgfs8mMFcm7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdHo6XiMJe6cUdT3fmx8x8iaPnEfHCJxv6uf6qPMPEzbb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWaqCj14twQ5sEmR5Le1vPZED3W7YQ44hCEgfs8mMFcm7", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2HpgpGoZtP58xrE1ZjFHFUjqrodJHzezaa"], "tags": ["NFTsMusic", "illustration", "NFTs", "NFTCommunity", "CleanNFTs"], "extra": {}}

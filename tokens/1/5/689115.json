{"__version": 1, "token_id": 689115, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Hydra of Lerna", "description": "This work is inspired by the Greek story of Hercules fighting the Hydra\n\nHydra is an animal that became a terror in the mythology of the Greek gods. They have bodies like dragons but with countless heads. As soon as one head is cut off, two more heads will appear in the same place.\n\nAlmost everyone who confronted the Hydra would surely die. However, Hercules managed to break the stigma. He and one of his nephews were able to cut off the hydra's head until it was gone.\n\nHydra is an immortal mythological figure. The figure of \"Hydra\" describes the challenges that are getting bigger and harder to handle.\n\nLife does feel so heavy if it is filled with problems that come and go. it seems it is no longer possible to solve all the problems that come repeatedly. when one problem has just been solved, suddenly new problems appear again. It's as if giving up and surrendering is the only option when we face all of that.\n\nWith this work, I hope to be able to give a reminder and encouragement to many people who are experiencing persistent problems like this Hydra. Maybe we are not as strong as Hercules, but with strong determination, surely all problems will be resolved properly. Don't give up, don't lose hope!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcHLUZnwv8TnLfAw8go1GZht2ZrpMWtckSKcMyPMyAWjS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP4nBPbPvMSGaNMUb5eZXTBoZf6SB8vJ2zyViMHYpky7V", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcHLUZnwv8TnLfAw8go1GZht2ZrpMWtckSKcMyPMyAWjS", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1QokCJUUmJ9ZaahH96EADBYsqKYHnK1ZAT"], "tags": ["illustration", "artwork", "darkart", "surrealism", "digitalillustration", "dragon", "hydra", "mythology", "dimeslab"], "extra": {}}

As a chronically ill artist with housing insecurities, I have only the sky to ground me.     10,000 is a unit of measurement commonly referred to in Buddhist and Taoist text that means the indefinite multitude of all forms and beings. In de-centering colonial standardization in measuring time, I am interested in creating my own in crip time, celebrating another day that I made it. Crip time is slow time, it\u2019s non-linear time travel, shifting backward and forward, flexing outwards and inwards. Coined by the disability justice movement on centering disabled bodies in how we experience time differently, it rejects capitalism\u2019s expectation of productivity, and discard universal notion of ablest time frame in honoring one\u2019s own pacing.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVAzXz2bvRaNjqEXfQ2Wcp2j9mA3RFWPcezEifBG9mY5z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPy4nP3wc79TBGn9VAAL6R8SpmDUZ41Co6vKctCFTLkai", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1hRt81kLiSze1Aon2BzQnWX1Q19aTyAKwq"], "tags": ["sky", "photography", "conceptualart", "ritual", "time", "sunset", "death", "unitofmeasurement", "documentation", "lydianstater"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmVAzXz2bvRaNjqEXfQ2Wcp2j9mA3RFWPcezEifBG9mY5z"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmRfzg8yVNGCif9ecBuiccykPPwB55foqbsDfyatf3CmQk"}, "supply": "5", "transfered": 0}

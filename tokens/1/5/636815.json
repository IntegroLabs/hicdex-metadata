Traditional weapons or heirlooms owned by Indonesia, especially in Aceh, are very rare and difficult to find. Because there have been many traditional relics or heirlooms that were lost after the historical period of the Aceh Kingdom. Siwah name, one of the traditional weapons owned by the area nicknamed 'Seurambi Mecca' in Indonesia. This Aceh Traditional Heritage was once used to fight against the invaders by Sultan Ali Mughayat Syah, the first Sultan who ruled the Sultanate of Aceh at that time. In addition to being used to fight against the former invaders, Siwah can also be categorized as the result of a traditional carving that is attached to the handle and scabbard of the knife. Then, as a piece of jewelry or a companion to traditional traditional clothing that is placed or tucked at the waist. Now, if you want to find this type of Traditional Heirloom like 'Siwah', it is usually only used as jewelry. And because it is used as jewelry, it has been given elements of gold and gems on the handle and scabbard. So, now apart from being rare we find, it turns out to be expensive too.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQVDsjbyrBMv7UJLNNbDrE97V9yxTD6G9ZYi9k6mnvT1X", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVnaY7WdkjB58Kwuzua2YzBGMp5pQ2b6b3MDr6o6y28rk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQVDsjbyrBMv7UJLNNbDrE97V9yxTD6G9ZYi9k6mnvT1X", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2CeMF8Atm6CuSTk1w8gGZNafCwqhSCpV79"], "tags": ["3d", "aceh", "indonesia", "traditional", "indonesia", "culture", "etnich"], "extra": {}}

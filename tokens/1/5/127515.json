Princess is an average sized fluffle with common coat, tail and frill. Her ears are a rare fairy mutation! Princess is aptly named and reflected in their personality. They expect the best food, bedding, toys, treats ect. Princess has been employed in the past by treat testers with their unnerving ability to detect subpar ingredients at even the smallest of levels.    Princess also abhors sale items, we're not sure how they knew an item was on sale, but we very much advise always paying full price for their goods. Please remember we are not liable for property damages once adoption has been completed.

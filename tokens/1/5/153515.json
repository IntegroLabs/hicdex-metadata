I always found the idea of secret symbols, codes, and code breaking interesting. As a result, I\u2019ve always found the big signals intelligence organizations in America\u2014the NSA, the NRO, and the NGA\u2014interesting too. As I got older and learned more about them, I\u2019ve also been continually irritated by their incompetence and their constant overreaching. The NSA, in particular, is to my mind the perfect example of the dangers of running overwhelming bureaucracy together with compartmentalized secrecy. This drawing is something like a record of me thinking about the structure and history of the NSA.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNyaMYHwoshcHKpASrGGiWawM1eQDZtbAfAdZ8fQZGThm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSxQj8PZVAR4K67ymqDGHs2A3ddMuubqd4T5yy4j1n1MU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNyaMYHwoshcHKpASrGGiWawM1eQDZtbAfAdZ8fQZGThm", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1dXJAzBPNg2wUEjmjLpZVrmdog4PiBv2wX"], "tags": ["#nsa#echelon#stateroom#prism#foxacid#illustration#flowchart#nft#fortmeade#xkeyscore"], "extra": {}}

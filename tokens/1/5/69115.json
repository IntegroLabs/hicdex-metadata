It wasnâ€™t until I stumbled across this pile and, despite the stench, got to work, stitching parts back together like a moist, spongy version of LEGOs. Eventually, the blood streams from the parts intermixed, and slowly but surely, a new life had been formed. Granted, it was a vengeful new life, but life nonetheless.

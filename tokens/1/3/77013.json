At that moment I was someone with a lot of dreams and no clue how I could make them happen. This picture is about a doctor supporting one of his sons for the thousandth time. My father to me has been a doctor, a carpenter, painter, friend, enemy, savior, partner, and among many other things photographer.  Love you dad. This picture was taken 3/2/2012, dad was 52.","tags":["photography","sunset","portrait"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmQaSfD2vrwiuMGwEhfu6jGdpJSuG28qp5u4GA58R4Udvm"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQaSfD2vrwiuMGwEhfu6jGdpJSuG28qp5u4GA58R4Udvm","display_uri":"ipfs://QmenPi14oiXtSompr1pSK9WN8Q7LCXNzm9e381igEmrXKn","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

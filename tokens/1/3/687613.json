{"__version": 1, "token_id": 687613, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ILLIBERAL", "description": "It seems these days that the proliferation of illiberal thoughts and actions coming from the political Right and Far-Right are almost out of control. For one, they have politicized mask wearing and Covid19 vaccinations, which makes zero sense to help end this pandemic. If anything, this exacerbates the situation and perpetuates the virus and infects the unvaccinated; seems counterintuitive and illogical at best. On top of all of this, the Right has fully been taken over by dangerous fringe ideology of the Far-Right that is illiberally trying to take away rights from millions of Americans. From women's rights over their own bodies to people of color having access to voting to focusing on culture wars as opposed to ending Covid19, the Right has no real platform of substance (let's honest...for the last 50 years have they had any substance?) and has devolved into an isolationist, fearmongering cult of personality that pledges total allegiance to the former Cheetoh-in-Chief, Donald J. Trump. If this wasn't such a dire time for so many people it would be fun to poke fun at them. We live in dangerous times and it just seems to be getting worse by the week. We can look at the word LIBERAL and how it spawns it's opposite, ILLIBERAL and that this ILLIBERAL spawns more ILLs and ILLIBERALS like a virus of misinformation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTnDKWCHLsmvbLKRoApWXtMToRt5pTMfWVAUzTYEkEcdd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVqxHbVLoitY2GN6B9p8NmJ8KRMRjvCpeR4pf3nHUTRMh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTnDKWCHLsmvbLKRoApWXtMToRt5pTMfWVAUzTYEkEcdd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

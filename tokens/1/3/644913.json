The act of assembling images became a type of Rorschach puzzle that could be put together differently every time depending on who looked at it. However for me, each collage became a portrait of sorts in its own way. Some of the relationships between the composition are heavier handed, others more subtle. It can be in how the image was cut or torn, which pieces peel or weave between layers, the subjects and objects themselves, all weaving together to become a dynamic quilt in its own right. This piece was challenging because I was trying to capture myself for myself. Maybe you'll see yourself in it, too.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcJkeTNkghjw8i3Jcat2maBmmhyVMzGC7cch1PaHyJ5BW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbeaTvPrDw9Pamh4EoURicn2pNoNMMoUYUmkYY9BUH6fa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcJkeTNkghjw8i3Jcat2maBmmhyVMzGC7cch1PaHyJ5BW", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VmZyzx1mMvhNtP7yWVcGr2Q5qJ3ghqeZB"], "tags": ["collage", "portrait", "handmade", "analog", ""], "extra": {}}

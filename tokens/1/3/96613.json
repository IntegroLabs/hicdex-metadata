In the style of Rauschenberg's 1953 erased de Kooning drawing, I slowly scratched and smudged away pixels on a single layer allowing the background color to show through. The digital erasers were relatively transparent, small strokes or smudges. Remaining pixels indicate some of the original forms.","tags":["digital","erased","monalisa","rauschenberg","dekooning"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmT9sSJdW8LrgWa3aaQau5GK93DP23mNzWekQK2SGAzg6n"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmT9sSJdW8LrgWa3aaQau5GK93DP23mNzWekQK2SGAzg6n","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

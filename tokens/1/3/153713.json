Extremely high-power sound waves can disrupt or destroy the eardrums of a target and cause severe pain or disorientation. This is usually sufficient to incapacitate a person. The use of these frequencies to incapacitate persons has occurred both in anti-citizen special operation and crowd control settings. The Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) produces a 30 degree cone of audible sound in frequencies within the human hearing spectrum (20 Hz \u2013 20kHz). ruanth.xyz", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdbWDyVYAntA54snMgrS92XKMLLL691j4ZFdvELFCjLSC", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc62pD8duryLuTLWosC23YnrHmWKcKt4T1paafh1AYzrB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdbWDyVYAntA54snMgrS92XKMLLL691j4ZFdvELFCjLSC", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Wyb4EkQkfvHBTgdQzTnQjxnhWFM3APagW"], "tags": ["ruanth", "resonance", "ruanth.xyz", "LRAD", "resonanceseries"], "extra": {}}

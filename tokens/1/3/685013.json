For the next handful of designs I'm going to be doing a series of monochrome layouts to try and instill some parameters for once since up to this point I really haven't given myself any. Day 153 is the first of the monochrome designs. I love shooting in cities and living on the Ohio River there are a ton of fantastic bridges, new and old. I love shooting them but as a Graphic Designer I also love the signage and complementary adverts surrounding said bridges. Bridges connect things, they solve problems, they bring things together and I love that. NFTs are doing something similar in terms of eliminating obstacles between world wide geography as well as bridging gaps between creators and collectors.

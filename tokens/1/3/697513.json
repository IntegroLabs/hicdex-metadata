You can only preach to egos. All I can do is talk about What IS. It amuses me to talk about What IS because IT is wonderful. I love IT, and therefore I like to talk about IT. My whole approach is not to convert you, not to make you over, not to improve you, but for you to Discover that if You really knew the Way You Were, things would be Sane.\" This quote is something that is so important to me, especially when talking about the experiences and wisdom that I feel I'm internalizing. I only present my truth to you, the reader. I'm not trying to make you think a certain way or sway your mindset whatsoever. These are expressions of my emotions and thoughts, you take or leave what you want from them.

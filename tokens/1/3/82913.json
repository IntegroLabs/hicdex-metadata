The dogs ran around, barking & chasing the bunny relentlessly, until the bunny ran out of batteries, collapsed & died. The second the bunny was lifeless, the dogs stopped caring. This photo often describes how I feel because I run myself ragged until I burn out, become exhausted, and physically & emotionally canâ€™t do any more.","tags":["photo","photography","death","dead","burnout","animal","bunny","taxidermy","millennial","peaceful","calm","nature","2012","sunnycrittenden"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmTxK1jZ67LXh61KvHX6AfnhjmkyvCTMSacF47c2b3jMfr"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTxK1jZ67LXh61KvHX6AfnhjmkyvCTMSacF47c2b3jMfr","display_uri":"ipfs://QmRqZE5aXShqfVcoptquVpTDHTkZGhHrFcsUdNiSUjvBew","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

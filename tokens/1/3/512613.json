Can we imagine a future with Aristotle's phrase \u201chuman completes what nature left unfinished\u201d, at a point where we ignore all human beings as an extension of nature, consider all their productions natural, and render human harm beneficial?\n\nIn line with this questions, I create serial nebulae that I call \u201cfractus\u201d, which I transform into a visual reality by using different materials*, intertwined chaotic and having fictitious truths in themselves.\n\n*I make oil paintings of the drawings I sketch. Afterwards, I photograph my oil paintings in macro scale and transform them into their new form in digital environment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbcWKdUmYZmpvE6uWYYfD4RG9HszfhUQLxuYwNCiQ4AUq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcK1xKtfgAjBDyQfxaW8qrJwg6D8b9eWSndFnXKa7crBT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbcWKdUmYZmpvE6uWYYfD4RG9HszfhUQLxuYwNCiQ4AUq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ejyfZorNfyZPR4swv7beKXLan5dSpxmLS"], "tags": ["monochrome", "loop", "paintings", "endless", "cloud", "blackandwhite", "mixedmedia", "oilpaintin", "oilpainting", "white", "penwork", "pen", "ink", "inkwork"], "extra": {}}

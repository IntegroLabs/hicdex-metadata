It is one of the masked dances of Indonesia. The other\u2019s include Topeng Cirebon, Topeng Bali, Topeng Malang & Topeng Reog. The dancer\u2019s costume is always fun and colorful. In the past it is used to ward of evil at milestone events such as a wedding or moving into a new home. As it is a dance from Jakarta, the metropolis I have lived at for most of my life, I also wanted to juxtapose Jakarta's traditional culture with its digital growth and metaverse future.\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago of over 17000 islands. There are many tribes, with their own individual dances and costumes, spread along these islands. I want to share with you the dances of my family heritage and of places I live.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXK6j2erQUK7c6ZYcK8c5eKB3oSC8J6hfUm8NgxWFJmz6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWnci5kTx66uik3SRQgSnmk5dWGC2FnBLGNzqK8Ha3t8y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZkefYqiHo1vNeeMzb1iYotzGgqJxmAJqK2kWuLbVZgWg", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXK6j2erQUK7c6ZYcK8c5eKB3oSC8J6hfUm8NgxWFJmz6", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2FQ9ciqi533mVrG8w1CvFP3xTKTE7jZGeV"], "tags": ["indonesia", "dancer", "dance", "girls", "city", "metaverse", "mask", "animation", "loop", "glitch", "distortion", "traditional"], "extra": {}}

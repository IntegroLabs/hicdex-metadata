Please Stand By, I'm Seeing Dead People, includes a color palette inspired by M. Night Shymalan 6th sense. Color played an incredibly important role in M. Night Shyamalan's The 6th sense. Shyamalan utilized the color red as a symbol of closeness between the real world and spiritual world, using it as a clue to the viewer in regards to the fates of certain characters.  This palette was plucked from a scene in which Haley Joel Osment's character is entering a church with large red doors.  The use of color in this scene was always something that stuck with me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSeRiXfPCV1Y7ioca4Dr1radVch8hdwzBw1Deefcnsosz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNycbnK88kSSa5uVPwQvEeVkjfos6g8VNmvgYRWyGPFJg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSeRiXfPCV1Y7ioca4Dr1radVch8hdwzBw1Deefcnsosz", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "digitalart", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "colorpalettes", "TV", "Film", ""], "extra": {}}

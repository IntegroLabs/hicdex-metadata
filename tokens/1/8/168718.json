The colors come from the normal mat-cap. The interlacing of surfaces is the result of flattening a 3D object into a single plane. Co-planar surfaces become interlaced as rounding errors in the depth buffer create an abstract geometric color field of woven pixels. 3200x2400 png", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXczmjHTRhWkhUCS73pbo2gxS2fefH1DWLVXLaeQ2LMHf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXczmjHTRhWkhUCS73pbo2gxS2fefH1DWLVXLaeQ2LMHf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXczmjHTRhWkhUCS73pbo2gxS2fefH1DWLVXLaeQ2LMHf", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PZ7a2uDxKHd2NouLrDyjFVfpvpfJ3HBNR"], "tags": ["z-fighting", "zfighting", "zfightclub", "geometric", "abstract", "color", "pixelart", "weaving", "pixelweaving", "glitch", "glitchart"], "extra": {}}

For me it is very important to be mastered so that it runs reflexively. Until now I always do that, back to basics in an effort to continue to practice shooting skills. Besides being an important part of a work journey, it is also very influential in making future works. This photo is part of a photographic composition exercise, made to meet the final exam for the photography composition course during college.

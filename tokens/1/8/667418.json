If y\u2019all wanna know, I couldn\u2019t draw for my personal needs, NFT, or whatever I enjoy. Like I always feel drained in my mind when I try to do it.\n\nIn that time, I didn\u2019t draw other than for work. There are a lot of friends who asked why I rarely draw again, I can\u2019t answer it clearly because I also don\u2019t know what happened to me. In the end, I chose to rest for awhile in the past few months.\n\nIt feels good to be back in this space again. Seeing the others have make a lot of progress and made something really cool.\n\nThis month, I hope I can continue what I\u2019ve started and rediscovered what was missing from it.

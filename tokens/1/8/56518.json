In April 2021, the vessel sank in the Bali Sea, and all 53 personnel aboard passed away. This 53-second 'perfect loop' soundtrack, accompanied by animation made by my wife, symbolizes the never-ending cycle of life -- their spirits will never be forgotten. The proceeds of this NFT will go 100% to the families of the 53 victims.

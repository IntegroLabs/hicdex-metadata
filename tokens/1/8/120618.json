This card urges you to listen to your inner voice and to follow your instincts.The High Priestess advises you to adhere to your chosen spiritual practice on a more regular basis. If you want the benefits of evolution, you'll have to cooperate with spirit. We all have distractions, demands -- a whole life full of reasons why we cannot find the time to retreat into our inner sanctum.  Until you consider this as vital to your well-being as the need to eat and sleep, you are likely to be eternally restless and deeply dissatisfied. A spiritual routine that suits your temperament, practiced every day, is the most trustworthy path to freedom.","tags":["tarot","highpriestess","priestess","major","arcana","nft","darkor","darko"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmUfv5qbZGnzWNFiSRHYUh7BkAPLijFRK1KVeZ1Ny6hTut","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUfv5qbZGnzWNFiSRHYUh7BkAPLijFRK1KVeZ1Ny6hTut","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVCcuKAjHrJzUhhF25YyW1nVzRnEnwnewv4fQLrpeSDNJ","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

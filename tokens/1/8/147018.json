I had only just discovered that 3-dimensional fractals had been invented/discovered two years before, and they fascinated me. I loved combining different formulae to see what would happen. Flying through fractal mathscapes and finding unique, interesting-looking shapes and scenes was, and still is, a thrilling experience.

I took longer than usual with it, playing around with parameters and colours, and eventually, rather proudly, saved the final image as a PNG.\u00a0 - // -\u00a0\u00a0 I would only give it its title months later, when I looked back and remembered what I was going through at the time. I was in Brazil, gradually being abandoned after almost two years, and more alone than I'd ever felt. And there had been fury...

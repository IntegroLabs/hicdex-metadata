At the time, I was a bassist playing in some jazz groups, meeting Rio's city musicians and studying composition. I can't remember what was my first music, but this was one of mine first pieces which I understood the effort of creating structures. I dedicate this music to Fernando Grilo.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfYUMK2ZjBNMbCySbGqxYGwzseZ2ECfQd8eVXe96mDkTV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVL9dckrnYLGq4VrroenUz4V5HXGLVMwyxQsP7HEazadV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfYUMK2ZjBNMbCySbGqxYGwzseZ2ECfQd8eVXe96mDkTV", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WUL3KZ7ecvUj5S4Yg8hG5oLwTP2vnbvBt"], "tags": ["jazz", "music", "mpbi"], "extra": {}}

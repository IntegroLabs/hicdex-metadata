Photo by Pavel Smirnov.\n\nUlyana Podkorytova is an artist, who explores the problems of loss of identity in the era of globalization and post-folklore. She works in video, voice performance, sculpture, and graphics.\u00a0Works are in the MMOMA, Moscow and private collections.\n\n\"The motifs of all the works are based on internal mythology, but at the same time, there are some references to the folklore of the Russian North, which inspires me.\u00a0\nI am attracted by the aesthetics of the terrible and the funny, as it is impossible to live without fun, knowing that life is finite\" - Ulyana Podkorytova.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaaWtHJsJfpVZbCvQxBjGjfo8mc8aDifxwxYjhFLyouhU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV2my8gZEoCdxENesif8edaFHemwz3zPFV4Mzw6eBJ7dE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZDT8szD9EoEMczopg3vngxHumFURgXpyZwDXswUFHzj8", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaaWtHJsJfpVZbCvQxBjGjfo8mc8aDifxwxYjhFLyouhU", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2HYMGDQZbY5SXnyfZn9Y7neNcxwmcyzkZC"], "tags": ["Podkorytova", "boys", "forest", "fairytales", "folklore", "russianmistake"], "extra": {}}

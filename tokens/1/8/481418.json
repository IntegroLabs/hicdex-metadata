Completely self-taught, and on the cover story of RawVision Magazine (#22), she became known for her one-of-a-kind books filled with page after page of impassioned, expressionistic faces and figures. Grgich often employs collage and vigorously applies layer after layer of over-painting, covering found texts and images, yet allowing some of the underneath to remain visible. This layering suggests generations of mystery and mystique to her exotic characters.\"-PhilDemise-Smith, Gallery A Studio\n\nhttps://rawvision.com/articles/balancing-books", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSN2FwQBgPvccQxD1Z9cdECPG58gAQ3DijLe25qFveEVs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZaDAVomVZrQJbA1psRCoE4XzB3GnmiXsvmYN6oxFH6gk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSN2FwQBgPvccQxD1Z9cdECPG58gAQ3DijLe25qFveEVs", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2WWBPDBAjfagGSTCnVL8ZPRXnU7LGgjPoT"], "tags": ["#love#hen#nftcommunity#cryptoart#tezos#nftartist#hicetnunc#nftcollectors#nftart#hicetnunc2000@onhicetnunc#nftdrop#crypto#cryptoartist#objkt#annegrgichtez##nftcollector#outsiderart#annegrgich#annemariegrgich#rawvisionmagazine#museum@annegrgich"], "extra": {}}

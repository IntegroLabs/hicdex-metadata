I just wanna show you what I'm goona bring to the NFT community. I am new in digital art, many things to learn, but I've been totally imerge in art since 2008 and I've lived many meaningfull experiences in this life that are reborning now with the mixed media that I'm approaching. Music is like food to me, I need it. I'm not a musician but I feel like I was xD. I am really hopefull that NFT business can bring me so much joy as music does! So I'm gonna work hard to bring joy to the community either. The world is shaking and my feelings are that we are all going through major changes, every day is a reborn. May we all reborn better each day, better with ourselfs and better to the others. In this music you can hear to my dear Djembe and my dear Berimbau, bouths instruments of great energy, may this sound be like the fire of the Phoenix and reborn in many other new projects! My Music collection is open! With a little stepp to make steppa, dub, reggae, ragga, dance hall, psytrance, eletronic, tribal, shamanic, medicine music, mantras, natural and atmosferical and experimental music!

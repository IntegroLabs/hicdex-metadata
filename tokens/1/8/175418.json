A fictional material popularized by a video game released in 2019. Motion-capture data based on performance by real living actors are entangled to these chiral alloy that has the physical properties to change its surface glossiness, albedo, shape, even mass. BT infestation is still a substantial risk when working with chiral alloys. However, the flexibility of this material are worth studying and used by artists alike.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfHShBsT5VVYPkvRWKVUSavGtiJhAdQU2iYs9rx5obpZP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcF1P6qKaBkRB13EZKTk4oasZKPPJBxvF3otndTuS9pEp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfHShBsT5VVYPkvRWKVUSavGtiJhAdQU2iYs9rx5obpZP", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1T73FRdDeoDidp2Uma4dc1HffRA9v8HcxU"], "tags": ["izzy", "digital", "cg", "cgi", "blender", "b3d", "motioncapture", "humaninterfacedevice", "chiral"], "extra": {}}

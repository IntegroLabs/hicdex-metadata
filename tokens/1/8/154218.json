After the lambs are born in spring, farmers chase their flock of sheep into the mountains where they spend the summer like wild animals. Every September, Icelandic shepherds on horseback roundup the 'wild' sheep found in the mountains and they are herded on mass back to the farm. Material for this photo series was shot during an artist residency in Akureryi, Iceland.

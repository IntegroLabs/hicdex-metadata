It might be, but there is significant truth within the words. Forget about it being clich\u00e9, what about it being myopic in scope and scale? It's not that life is short, it's that reality is WAY bigger than what we think of as life and that the present moment is the only thing that actually exists for our consciousnesses within the framework of space and time. All we have in our life is time. How much time? Nobody knows that. We might have wins and losses, victories and failures, friendships and enemies, loves and loathes, but the only thing that truly exists is now; like right now. This sentence you're reading, now. So you have all of the rest of your life to live! You're almost done with this ridiculous book; you're 95.2% completed!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdvpoPwfaFt2z7Cx2QTSBb7PPnsRnbFAzzRCFXQ4ZMuRt", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcs9PbT2MzV6G7TDkkYKxqJpz8Mfx6Bi1tHaSLfWJz2JE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdvpoPwfaFt2z7Cx2QTSBb7PPnsRnbFAzzRCFXQ4ZMuRt", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

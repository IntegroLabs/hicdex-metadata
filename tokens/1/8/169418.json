The chosen animal would grant you its gifts in exchange for them being used to protect life and nature. \nIf this agreement was broken, the power was corrupted and transformed the sorcerer into a monster, half animal, half human, thus revealing his nature and exposing him to the rest of the humans, who did not tolerate magic. They were persecuted and finally killed, most of them in horrible and unimaginable ways.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQwHhA27a9HBV2aXq1ZapkC54GaJuuUvCbaTTGcL3T152", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX8k42tCxuD8z2JnqV6i23E1Ho66JPogA1jK3w85a6nkV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmQwHhA27a9HBV2aXq1ZapkC54GaJuuUvCbaTTGcL3T152"}], "creators": ["tz1WybfACSmvJfjz1NGHtshLvhLkNJtUfNzN"], "tags": ["3D", "crow", "magic", "metal", "copper", "stone", "black", "dark", "light", "oddcr0w", ""], "extra": {}}

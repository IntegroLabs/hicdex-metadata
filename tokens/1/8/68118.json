Almost a year ago to the day he stayed still long enough for me to get close enough for this shot, I'd had so many through the year of him turning to run away just when I'd got my framing dialled in. I am very proud of this piece.","tags":["photograph","fox","brighton"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmYLApruWjdro8z2KVZrbpiN37YLjALpBVZdJfEsowJ2kc"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYLApruWjdro8z2KVZrbpiN37YLjALpBVZdJfEsowJ2kc","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

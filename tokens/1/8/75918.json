They are easily angered and will always seek vengeance on humans who disturb their mounds. A Filipino custom is to say the phrase \"Tabi-tabi po\" when passing by an anthill to avoid being cursed by an angry Nuno. Nuno curses are ailments that cannot be cured by modern medicine and will often result in death.","tags":["nuno","nunosapunso","cyclops","aswang","cryptid","monster","creature","mythology","myth","Philippines","Filipino","Pilipino","Pinoy","black","dark","illustration","digital"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmdkicTpWeXGgDDAYizZKGsCX374B2utBxsEzSrooVDski"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdkicTpWeXGgDDAYizZKGsCX374B2utBxsEzSrooVDski","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

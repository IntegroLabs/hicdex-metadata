The tears, symbolize distress and the bloody red color represents its desire to help relieve the pain. The sea of reflection shows the unclear and blurry future, but there is still hope mankind will abandon the path of self-destruction, become self aware and live in peaceful harmony with nature. The shape of the entity represents the required balance which is not static, but more like a beautiful dance.

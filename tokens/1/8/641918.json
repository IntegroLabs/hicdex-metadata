{"__version": 1, "token_id": 641918, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Dreaming", "description": "Dreaming is the tenth work in the FACES collection. This is a self-portrait in which I visualize what it feels like to be a dreamer, both the wonderful and sad side of it.\nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWFQFFfaNZR7w5RmgYNtCYQga3pEz62KiTXrQexVbikS6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXDP5kuN9evPbBe1jgVVqSFbgiwWCc3fJgz6BQkTmeALs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWFQFFfaNZR7w5RmgYNtCYQga3pEz62KiTXrQexVbikS6", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours", "dreams"], "extra": {}}

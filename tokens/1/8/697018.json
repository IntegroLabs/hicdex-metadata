This song is about how it felt like being a kid and playing outside pretending to be Batman after watching the cartoon or a movie, and how the realities of life slowly stripped down that magic and how I'm faced with all kinds of challenges, real life villains. There's so much happening in the world right now, this song is about fighting to keep that wonder we had when we were kids playing outside and all the possibilities that came with that view of the world, the belief that nothing is impossible if we stay true to ourselves and fight through the doubts and fears that constantly plague us. One day at a time.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZnb966LdoFvayLLeu3uLTM19ck82ytDi2Sw4F7ESQvuG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTayrk87KnqPfTCptocjYfewz2CHN1AAJzb4BZGvY7Rqo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZnb966LdoFvayLLeu3uLTM19ck82ytDi2Sw4F7ESQvuG", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg", "compressedAudioUri": "ipfs://QmPgZT8KDiLqyt6rYnWBXjstJeFpxb9k5tBiK7jCexzbgv", "coverThumbUri": "ipfs://QmZFEHpQzdrTQiRmdERewxUB2vu3rjLMF4qcK2UgjDgTtc"}], "creators": ["tz2SBm8qZMe3P2jVV5bt1wcwjUjcgWBYnz4S"], "tags": ["Batman"], "extra": {}}

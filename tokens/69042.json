So 299880/299992 seats. 4th fleet is booked for Colombian protesters, may 2021: https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/68279. Today May 8, 2021, the question of the power of decision & action between humans & machines still remains unanswered. Coming fleets of trucks will therefore be sold at the lowest possible price as a dissuasion to machines until a human-machine balance is found.

The artist brought their laptop out into the world and placed it in a variety of natural settings, arranged a mirror so that the laptop could see its reflection, and ran code that used the laptopâ€™s webcam to take a photo of itself in the mirror.   After taking thousands of photos over several months, the laptop used the dataset it had gathered as the training data for a StyleGAN network. Using this neural network, the laptop was able to learn to generate unique self-portraits, set in a world of its own imagination.  The videos in this series are the unedited outputs of the model, documenting its progression.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYJEZVNgDCZZkSsKpi3eu83qUe5FCQm9L6p8rZzAWZFuw","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmYJEZVNgDCZZkSsKpi3eu83qUe5FCQm9L6p8rZzAWZFuw"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmY1ZZsfQzh9tNPnkPDtgDW4VeUJp8Nd1UwakpgvGtVGcC"},"supply":"10","transfered":23}

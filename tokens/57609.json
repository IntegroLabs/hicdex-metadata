Those pieces are so recognizable and so amazing, that even breaking it down to 21x21 pixels we can still see it. Squish your eyes to see it better. ;) Art that is almost indestructible.

And I added another one.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXgtuicxdd9wsg9nxdAzCidPCU91mSgznZqCup254NqMF","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1N6FrkgLbnfT1tAWDhr3dgUJvP92XsqJpj"],"tags":["HicPixels#001"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmXgtuicxdd9wsg9nxdAzCidPCU91mSgznZqCup254NqMF"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmXscfhbn4RPNQFhkk9VDNVZn7Ey1nUENpPfseJz2FPe1S"},"supply":"20","transfered":20}

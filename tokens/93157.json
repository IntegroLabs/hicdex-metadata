He is currently homeless is Erie, Pa. At first he was NOT interested in letting me take a photo. I started talking to the guy next to him about NFTs and explained what I was doing. After a while, he motioned over and said Why not, lets do it. I told him that if I made any money, Id come back to find him. Pops gets the first 50% of all sales, the rest will be donated to the Erie Mission. The only money that I will keep will be the 10% royalties on secondary sales.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbqUqoKtyeHcRXj4j63F7ZrKURCMZP8JCFFa75GHCixNh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1dsuRQ4Yxn71wK3yUMZXdQRgvKrnhTwQiA"], "tags": ["somethingstrange", "erie", "homeless", "mission", "pops"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmbqUqoKtyeHcRXj4j63F7ZrKURCMZP8JCFFa75GHCixNh"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmPA4LA26d7oNwubBDeeZg5a7wJfAkLfefCmuAAioK8WFD"}, "supply": "50", "transfered": 51}

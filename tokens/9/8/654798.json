{"__version": 1, "token_id": 654798, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Little Girl in a Blue Armchair (Petite fille dans un fauteuil bleu)", "description": "Algorithmic interpretation of an 1878 oil painting by the American painter, printmaker, pastelist, and connoisseur Mary Cassatt. It is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. Edgar Degas made some changes in the painting.\n\nThe museum page provenance suggests the painting was possibly shown at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition 1879 as Portrait de petite fille.\n\nBy 1877 Cassatt had come into frank conflict with the official French art establishment and had had both her submissions for that year rejected by the Salon. So when Edgar Degas invited her to join the Impressionists the same year, a group similarly disaffected by the Salon system, she accepted with alacrity. A planned 1878 exhibition did not take place, because of what Degas judged would be competition from the World's Fair held in Paris that year, but she did hold what amounted to a show of her own at the Spring 1879 Impressionist exhibition, exhibiting a dozen oils and pastels. Exactly which works these all were is not now known with certainty, but it is likely that Little Girl in a Blue Armchair was amongst them.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYWFZTMFo6JJ5ZP3WaJtca1qJ1kZECqtmgHdAr3JV9eVC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVD2J4ajo5dxPbmhXtoCb13D2ouyV6NmJJTFJNhYJBGiC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYWFZTMFo6JJ5ZP3WaJtca1qJ1kZECqtmgHdAr3JV9eVC", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz2L8LMuCTipzj35q8ETsF1fPnVqokR1KzrM"], "tags": ["repaint", "LittleGirlinaBlueArmchair", "impressionism", "Petitefilledansunfauteuilbleu", "interactive", "html", "creative"], "extra": {}}

This is technically a color pun, but the emphasis isn't really on the word BLUE. The design, look, and feel of this work is so different than most of the other images from this book, which we could say that it came out of the blue or not expected. Also, in this work the word \"OUT\" is physically outside of THE BLUE section of the image, so it's literally out of the blue.

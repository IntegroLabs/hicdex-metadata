The plate presents the main still life from which many begin their creative path in drawing. I start but do not finish it for various reasons. Shedding a lot of blood sweat and wasting your precious time wasting your life. Often left with nothing and only after their departure are recognized.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYtxPgPXE5QAvSgPcw9Ck1Gbm8AUk4Ln2thumdF5W6UEV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZkk3ewBWvN2bEiH4b2BpFxQZAv4EfXr4YV5UWbmVP8L7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYtxPgPXE5QAvSgPcw9Ck1Gbm8AUk4Ln2thumdF5W6UEV", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gu5EBHu8eDvtAVBq8ZzwozuWAhUHH6cVZ"], "tags": ["pipolsoboi", "koloto"], "extra": {}}

The fat eth wallets and fat eth cats, the people selling on every single market space available, the companies asking $500 to mint and sell on their platforms. This is not about me this is about us, the 1s and 0s. The artists left out, the ones finding their feet. Who am I? I am 101! Twitter 101art101 please RT if you buy and Support.

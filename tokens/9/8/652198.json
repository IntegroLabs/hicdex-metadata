Let this be a formal invitation to all the Les \u00c9l\u00e9fants-holders around the globe. Hereby you are formally invited to our humble project.\n\nWhen the French decided to chop the British middle fingers off, in the hope of stopping these magnificent arrow shooters from killing them, they assumed they would never get shot again; well, you know that the middle finger is the most outstanding finger to shoot arrows. To their surprise, the British turned out to be victorious; then they erected the middle finger to show the French their source of power. That is exactly what the middle finger is to us. Love, Peace, Not giving up; being hopeful, and also mastering the art of not giving a fuck!\n\nwww.tezfingers.xyz", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmShnGZLeoH3d1wpHtqyPQMo2sYYyjSuAPutkJ8Y7HD8jZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmShnGZLeoH3d1wpHtqyPQMo2sYYyjSuAPutkJ8Y7HD8jZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmShnGZLeoH3d1wpHtqyPQMo2sYYyjSuAPutkJ8Y7HD8jZ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XXCsZnEhWQdNvbXwfyT1cmMU8nahrkJCT"], "tags": ["HouseofSkratz", "TezFingers", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}

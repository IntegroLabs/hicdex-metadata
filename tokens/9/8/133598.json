It was not chosen and it feels like you can’t choose where it goes. Which you don’t. Every decision you make will have a different outcome then you intended. But you’re still on the road. No crashes. No complications. That’s what matters. You’re still on the road. And if you remain there, you will get to the end and see the result of your journey. That’s when you see what impact your life has had.","tags":["Photography","Art"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmYJvocns6TbBD6BvdZruJA6oZG8pZ2tEL36FwrFT6Mr7Q","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYJvocns6TbBD6BvdZruJA6oZG8pZ2tEL36FwrFT6Mr7Q","display_uri":"ipfs://QmYNnU1ijFtkoQaCkbaRTUB1LLdyN2s8S5Wa2r9A77GJGD","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

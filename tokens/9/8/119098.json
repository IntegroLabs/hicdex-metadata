{"name": "Polaroid from the moon", "description": "A childhood dream of mine is to take a trip over the moon, land on the moon and grab a fist full of moon dust. So, I decided to make this polaroid colorful and childish, paying homage to the child that still resides within me. The project \"Polaroids From Space\" is a collection of digital polaroids taken by an imaginary astronaut during his space adventures, with each one capturing a different place in space. This polaroid was inspired when I applied to the Dear Moon mission. Fly me to the moon!

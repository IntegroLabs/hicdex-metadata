The saci is a young black imp with one leg, always with his red hood that grants him magical powers. Considered a playful figure, who has fun with animals and people, doing little tricks that create domestic difficulties, or scaring night travelers with their whistles - quite acute and impossible to be located. That is how he braids the horses' hair, after leaving them tired with running; it disrupts the cooks' work, making them burn their food, or even adding salt to the sugar containers or vice versa; or travelers get lost on the roads.","tags":["Brazil","Folkart","Folk","Digitalart"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmVBToGfcobrhm4dhce6xZatESGZHghqAN2huWiYE35rz5","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVBToGfcobrhm4dhce6xZatESGZHghqAN2huWiYE35rz5","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXG7vzfsP161f1YMwoNsaccdXXjH5EDKnLjnt96qVFgGf","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

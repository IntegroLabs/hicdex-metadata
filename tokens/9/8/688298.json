It has no mainframe.\nOnce the emission started, everthing seemed to be out of no known source,\nand what was once stainless became blue, purple and organik. The outcomes\nstarted to float from the main turbine. Once this selected rainbow-like\nsubstance began pouring, that's when all the bends and leaps started to\nhappen. Could only watch it from a distance, trying to understand its\nnew shapes and movements, but the ripples went slowly getting to my \nvision, from a distance. Small portalized holes, gave space to a branched\nbiome that took control of the mid-frame, making it more and more burstable.\nThere was no coming back, no return. It was now under a new flux, a different\nexistance to what it was for so long, its immeasurable stillness. The eyemakine.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUQD4CCTi56yjkmBHLpS5dsGGY4wTfoDR8N61fGSTiEoy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVodVV2UBeGm6hcCN3NSEH7UF9eswbWLQ6AZSbQ7UQ2Xi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUQD4CCTi56yjkmBHLpS5dsGGY4wTfoDR8N61fGSTiEoy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["KT19o3eJ8nZueZVWocf8MYKRPquKLeCVssqV"], "tags": ["cyber-vision", "dreamachines", "collaboration", "kosmic", "dreamcore", "planetaryripple", "konstruct", "metamerger", "REM", "glitch", "post-abstract"], "extra": {}}

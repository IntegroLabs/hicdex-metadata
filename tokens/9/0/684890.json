The invasion of a sovereign nation finally convinced the allies \u2013 Great Britain and France of Hitler\u2019s wider intentions for the occupation of Europe. After appeasing Hitler over Austria and Czechoslovakia, Poland proved the final straw and on September 3rd, 1939, Great Britain declared war on Nazi Germany. The Second World War was to last until May 1945, costing the lives of approximately 50 million people. Less well known is that under a secret Nazi-Soviet pact the Soviet Union also occupied parts of Poland at the same time as Germany\u2019s invasion.\n\n\t\nEnglish: The Nazi-soviet Invasion of Poland, 1939\nRed Army soldier guarding a Polish PWS-26 trainer aircraft shot down near the city of R\u00f3wne (Rivne) in the Soviet occupied part of Poland.\nDate\t18 September 1939\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY8FfGqHHSxsqBHDYTASGBXC9UduQBzAXCay8t3Lg8xAL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSCjXUcS8kMZLKqGU1QEz5QDQhQhGwVcraH1LcXK1RicJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY8FfGqHHSxsqBHDYTASGBXC9UduQBzAXCay8t3Lg8xAL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1W12zMqhdSfGF3EjkRJ4tXUqq4cagX6S9G"], "tags": ["news"], "extra": {}}

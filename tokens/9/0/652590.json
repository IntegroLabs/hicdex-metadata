July 8, 2016 was the day I started playing Pokemon Go! Going on 6 years later and I still play every day. As of Day 125, Jan 29 2022, I am level 49 and half way through XP wise to the final level of 50. When I started playing I had only been living in Louisville for about a year and aside from people that my wife knew I really didn't have many of my own friends. Pokemon Go changed that. The game really did give millions of Pokemon lovers a reason to go outside, get some exercise and more importantly socialize. It's really not that different from the relationships that I've been forming in the crypto space. In both cases common ground brought us together, and in both cases long lasting genuine connections were made. Just because you've never met someone and they live on the other side of the planet doesn't mean they're any less of a true friend than someone you could see IRL.

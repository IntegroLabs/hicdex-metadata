{"__version": 1, "token_id": 472790, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BROTHERED", "description": "From BROTHERED, we can create a sentence that reads, HER OTHER BROTHER HERE, THE RED BROTH THERE. We don't know where the previous brother is, but given the context that the \"OTHER BROTHER\" is \"HERE\", the prior brother must be THERE somewhere, but not HERE. We do know that \"THE RED BROTH\" is \"THERE\". Is \"THE RED BROTH\" over \"HERE\"? We don't know. Is this absolute malarkey? Absolutely, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The original word, \"BROTHERED\" is an integral aspect of the work and is not hidden. These are fun to play with and there are certain key mutant words to look for like: THERE. Within the word THERE are words like: The/He/Her/Here. That's 5 words in one. You can do so much with just one word. There are others as well...let's find them!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXJDYTePLeLRJm2aAzTomub7qCipbQK9Y49FN9s8NEi8Y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQeHenzQMPFdKkhD1xC6E1Vvwd6fBDVTAU1ShCBqEtHmn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXJDYTePLeLRJm2aAzTomub7qCipbQK9Y49FN9s8NEi8Y", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

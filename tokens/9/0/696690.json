How you taught me to calm down, to sit back, to listen ;\nI like how you offer the littles a shelter, and allow them to watch\nthe world from upstairs.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Generative drawing\n\u2014 Made with Javascript code\n\u2014 Format JPG\n\u2014 Resolution 4455x6300", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRvr92CtWxJzGeSVRxxhVFDxutcjn4fmsWLD3E8rmnDh6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYNmYiANHKrvcqL6P9XAzi5d2jPcbdcBXrafvvNdqiFuB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRvr92CtWxJzGeSVRxxhVFDxutcjn4fmsWLD3E8rmnDh6", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1emnbiCPzMub8eihHpomZXrZPijLK3FxnB"], "tags": ["generativeart", "monochrome", "tree", "javascript", "lushtemples"], "extra": {}}

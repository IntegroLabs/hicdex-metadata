{"__version": 1, "token_id": 683290, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "L'Porm Sonas - The First Mother", "description": "~ One of the eldest demi-gods, her origins date back to the first forays into tech-based godhood. Her moniker is drawn from her occupation as a geneticist, participating in the creation of her fellow Deumana. It was these beings that pioneered the organic machinery that sped their celestial development, combining cutting edge methods with resurrected techniques formerly thought lost amongst coded, alchemical texts. \n\nThough erased from many records by jealous and vain competitors, her lasting impact can be found in the darker regions of Lume. The clandestine factions that still worship the fallen gods - and wish for their return - use her name in place of a revolutionary hero of the Schism, A'tak Taal, when they measure their days. Thus \"Di'Sonas\" replaces \"Di'Taal\" as the first day of each Cycle. Life is subjective; one culture's villain is another's hero. ~\n\nUncover more about this brutal, fallen god, as well as other denizens of Lume, below:\nhttps://lumelibrary.com/index.php?title=L%27Porm_Sonas", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUCigTP82V4EzWT3efRxJcygeH232QUuNtkfvWG9JtDFo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXUQDPDazgDwXNYPPQD8iG2KTjksdkXhtTS9e6Re2CgCh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUCigTP82V4EzWT3efRxJcygeH232QUuNtkfvWG9JtDFo", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fqhYjbMFvYTvZ1WVMa7dPpyks4CYtpd1n"], "tags": ["illustration", "horror", "fantasy", "world-building", "runes", "alchemy", "gothic"], "extra": {}}

Generated by a hand-coded python application, the work is built on an instruction set that combines rectangles, ellipses, clipping paths, and fills to create geometric, conceptual, modern works that are structured in their composition, but organic in their rendition. All quantities, sizes, positions, and pallets are generated by the application. ukraine-62033 was rendered to raise funds for the citizens of Ukraine, and all proceeds go directly to the Ukraine Fundraiser smart contract at KT1DWnLiUkNtAQDErXxudFEH63JC6mqg3HEx. The art exists as an svg to preserve the integrity of the original and allow viewing and reproduction at any size.\n\nGenerative art created by MaxBore.\nOfficial wallet: maxbore.tez\nOfficial Twitter account: https://twitter.com/themaxbore", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV39Q8rffGnakk7tCfjtwfAQio7Mr87LbUcrQDwuYpEi5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV39Q8rffGnakk7tCfjtwfAQio7Mr87LbUcrQDwuYpEi5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV39Q8rffGnakk7tCfjtwfAQio7Mr87LbUcrQDwuYpEi5", "mimeType": "image/svg+xml"}], "creators": ["KT1PDmuZV4c6vXBLT7aaLeJZBSeC9AXrdHVn"], "tags": ["ukraine", "peace", ""], "extra": {}}

Only his purpose is not to fight wars, but rather to rescue innocent people.  He is calm and confident and will not back down until he completes his mission.\n\nHe does not talk much and prefers action to discussion. When he sets his mind to doing something there is little anyone can do to stop him.  He flies into the air and swoops up the person in need, all the while fighting off any evil thing in his way.\n\nPegasus' feathers are iridescent in color and react directly to his actions, if you watch him closely you can tell his mood by the colors of his feathers.\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRbJERKJ6LAa63o6wzDY7VWY3KwMpDi3LrzZj5fj7W57v", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc3EwHoahe2wipPRSB9fx2Q71NV1GRmHcP2w6wGEnCWZe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRbJERKJ6LAa63o6wzDY7VWY3KwMpDi3LrzZj5fj7W57v", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld", "myth", "myths", "pegasus", "wings"], "extra": {}}

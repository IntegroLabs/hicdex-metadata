However prior to the heist - in 1976, the museum accidentally discovered that the painting was altered. XRay images during a restoration project revealed the presence of a child, specifically a boy. It has been assumed that the child had died and that the presence of the child in the painting was too painful of a reminder for Rembrandts patrons to bare; and so the child was painted out. The parents had tried to erase the memory of the child and the world had likewise forgotten him. Thieves later stole the painting and with it, all memory of the family. The HEU undertook to bring back to life the child the world had forgotten. We took the XRAY images taken in '76 and applied AI super resolution to them via a custom google collab notebook. The enhanced references were then used by the exceptional painter Mariano Sangalli, along side period clothing references. Sangalli painstakingly and lovingly painted the child back into the portrait. On Valentine\u2019s day, Feb 14, 2022, the Family was reunited.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZuw2qp9CiYmLgUhAV2m8y2x2kb4R87GGVwfU5i6FGM2X", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV5bdxooPnssK2givYLtTrQkVtGUfqHbGxXUoqWcYjcSL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZuw2qp9CiYmLgUhAV2m8y2x2kb4R87GGVwfU5i6FGM2X", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1a4N8YdJmazRKt2fr5thmSqMLhhGN7ChNX"], "tags": ["Rembrandt", "MarianoSangalli", "Heist", "XRay", "Reunion", "Love", "History", ""], "extra": {}}

I created them in TwoToJazz on iPad, using multi-touch gestures; i.e., my thumb and index finger as the calligraphic brush. I then overlaid and mixed the images in other apps. As for the textures, I use multiple other TwoToJazz works of mine. TwoToJazz itself is developed by me. | Creation date: June 1sr, 2019","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSVPK9gNd4sm7SgBFVnfpPQQjnkXZN952b85B4FoXJuNM","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmSVPK9gNd4sm7SgBFVnfpPQQjnkXZN952b85B4FoXJuNM"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmaiihF9z1WZmmmEgwGn2rs1Aj8a4nPde8XA3DBzxzux9u"},"supply":"3","transfered":7}

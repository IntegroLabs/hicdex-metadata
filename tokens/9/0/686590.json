Ninjas, like samurai, obeyed their own distinctive rules, called ninpo. According to some observers of ninjutsu, the skill of a ninja is not assassination but infiltration. Ninja comes from the Japanese language which reads nin which means to infiltrate. So, the special skill of a ninja is to infiltrate with or without sound.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTgQpmiH64ZmG3JDrPXh8dCGpz1fx31PEhC38reh21mYm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZPJLjLnVw3wim8Ur8Xyp3FkGkr8ffRwWZ7Q8bpsGvTny", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTgQpmiH64ZmG3JDrPXh8dCGpz1fx31PEhC38reh21mYm", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2G552uy7KA749MEgaKnBQcxciQdh41KURd"], "tags": ["animation", "illustration", "japan", "ninja", "artwork"], "extra": {}}

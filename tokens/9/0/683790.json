(ALAN WATTS)", "description": "It's been a minute since I thought about the brilliant work and words of Alan Watts. These words resonated so deeply in me that I had to put his words here. What do these words mean though and why are they so perfectly poignant? The way I perceive them is that everything and everyone are connected in this thing called the universe. We are atoms and particles in motion regardless if we're alive or not. We're all doing the same thing; existing in space at some point in time. To explore this concept we can do a twist (literally) on the mantra mandala. Instead of spinning on one axis, we can intimate movement from one side and one level of space to another side and another level. To clarify, from what my myopic brain understands of quantum physics is that even though some objects remain \"still\", their atoms and particles are still vibrating within quantum fields. But beyond the quantum, the imperceivable, and the inconceivable we can relate his words to a human level. We are all existing, being alive at the same time in this moment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdz7TsvRxssz14JpTj6Ruuo8ihfkjGvSXfZRmxgyxLjn7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSWD16uDzX2DvBUCncuNNvPJpcqc1qGjyyXRvSWhHTcQ5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdz7TsvRxssz14JpTj6Ruuo8ihfkjGvSXfZRmxgyxLjn7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

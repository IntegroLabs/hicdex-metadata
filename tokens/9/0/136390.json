Each point moves in a direction directly opposite the nearest point. The result is a state of dynamic equilibrium, which may be disturbed by adding, removing, or moving points; I invite you to do so. This work also includes interactive settings including color, opacity, speed, line width, line type, and light/dark modes. The dark/light mode is automatically determined based on your current time (night or day), but may also be toggled. Variable line width is determined by the distance between points (closer=thinner, further=thicker). Full controls may be found in the web console, otherwise click & scroll around with your keys and mouse.","tags":["interactive","generative","geometry","lines","points"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmSYVHZPb9uq3v7JXyR18GZuYJjGXMhd5H63nzhwyYcXTa","mimeType":"application/x-directory"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSYVHZPb9uq3v7JXyR18GZuYJjGXMhd5H63nzhwyYcXTa","display_uri":"ipfs://QmSNMdqzZDB1A3ZktzsoqJYmhUhdJx2X39hhTDhFNRkvYt","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmSNMdqzZDB1A3ZktzsoqJYmhUhdJx2X39hhTDhFNRkvYt"}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 136390, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Moving Points", "description": "\"Moving Points\" is a generative interactive work in which randomly positioned points are in constant motion. Each point moves in a direction directly opposite the nearest point. The result is a state of dynamic equilibrium, which may be disturbed by adding, removing, or moving points; I invite you to do so. This work also includes interactive settings including color, opacity, speed, line width, line type, and light/dark modes. The dark/light mode is automatically determined based on your current time (night or day), but may also be toggled. Variable line width is determined by the distance between points (closer=thinner, further=thicker). Full controls may be found in the web console, otherwise click & scroll around with your keys and mouse.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSYVHZPb9uq3v7JXyR18GZuYJjGXMhd5H63nzhwyYcXTa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSNMdqzZDB1A3ZktzsoqJYmhUhdJx2X39hhTDhFNRkvYt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmSNMdqzZDB1A3ZktzsoqJYmhUhdJx2X39hhTDhFNRkvYt", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSYVHZPb9uq3v7JXyR18GZuYJjGXMhd5H63nzhwyYcXTa", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1hjsJLB4iX74cJ8zsemWY7K2mobWBzmee3"], "tags": ["interactive", "generative", "geometry", "lines", "points"], "extra": {}}

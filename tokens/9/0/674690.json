The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.\n\nThe bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.\n\nNow he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.\n\n\"What a fool I am,\" he said. \"Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.\"\n\nAnd off he walked very, very scornfully\".\n\nAesop.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWsVnjNfeShekHBSD5Koh1ZRDPvy2D423HfLHTCPkx4vD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNfu9FxpNJH1Sgurg86MHjuZVssfCgpTrt7kwEwzzPoBc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWsVnjNfeShekHBSD5Koh1ZRDPvy2D423HfLHTCPkx4vD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Eu3XGSf7115d1TSnBMhTKxNTXNAoY6URU"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

{"name": "Karen ", "description": "My take on a specimen we've all seen: The entitled white woman. During the Covid19 lockdowns we got to see first hand how aggressive and entitled people were when their comfort levels were barely pushed. Among all incidents, the ones where white women refused to wear masks, harassed people with racial slurs, and treated store employees horribly for just doing their jobs, were the worst and most infamous. Enjoy, and may you never be, a Karen.

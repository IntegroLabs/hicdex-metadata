{"name": "PURE ANIMAL ENERGY", "description": "Every living being is a being of energy. The Hinoki wooden portal is the same wood used to build Japanese temples, shrines and palaces in ancient times, such as Osaka Castle and Horyuji Temple, which are still standing and in shape after 1,300 years. This portal evokes the energy of all living beings and this energy manifests in your lower vibration. Animals play many roles when it comes to energy, their energy fields are much more expansive than ours.", "tags": ["Energy", "vibrational", "animal", "frequency", "Vibe", "Hinoki", "Portal"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmX2bzqWRTx139jwpvX3vNW4CjCA9RnacQoKx49t5rfvQ1", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmX2bzqWRTx139jwpvX3vNW4CjCA9RnacQoKx49t5rfvQ1", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1gq8KyYsmZiNh7qBwq2YjPebJW15FLFWFc"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX2bzqWRTx139jwpvX3vNW4CjCA9RnacQoKx49t5rfvQ1", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

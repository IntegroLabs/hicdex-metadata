{"__version": 1, "token_id": 673597, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LIVE / LIVE WELL / LIVE WEALTHY", "description": "Growing up whenever my mother bought me new clothes, she used to tell me \"wear them well\". Wise words from a sagacious woman. My father roughly around the same time period told me \"the best form of revenge was success\". Not sure if he was gearing me up to have enemies or prepare me for the onslaught of awful men in this world. Either way it helped me to stay focused on being productive and hard working. So when we combine these two totally different influences we get the following: LIVE / LIVE WELL / LIVE WEALTHY. They both obviously wanted me to have a life and to live, but not just to exist; to thrive and live well. If you're living well, then chances are you're living wealthy (and not in terms of financial wealth, although I'm sure that couldn't hurt). Living wealthy would be the full spectrum of living the fullest possible life: giving/receiving love, being eternally compassionate to everyone, having purpose and direction in life, laughing, being physically active, doing good in the world, etc. For the last 5 years, I've been changing the way I live, consume, and integrate myself into and with society; the pandemic accelerated the transformation process quite a bit. As like many others in the world, the past year a half has been the perfect reflection/inflection point in our lives. What is it that I really want out of life? What do I want to do with the rest of my life? What is my passion? How do I truly achieve my dreams with the remaining years of consciousness left? Did you have a similar epiphany? If not, that's ok. Take a moment to reflect and think about the rest of your life. What do you want?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP94KTa3PUfUaihkFv7W9LUQhXFdgKSMbuKnWt79VEKiF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXKMeuXS2wE5HVu3MxPJ4DkyzxTUwTVLbiNS9gwUiKPDe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP94KTa3PUfUaihkFv7W9LUQhXFdgKSMbuKnWt79VEKiF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

This painting came as a design in an art history project in college. The objective was to illustrate a god or goddess. Sedna is a beautiful invoking spirit of the sea. A protector of all things aquatic from wildlife species to the pristine waters or inlet bays and vast bodies of water. It is believed that many fishermen and vessels have gone to bed in a deep watery grave because of their disrespectful actions. A just sentence as a result of such poor moral actions.

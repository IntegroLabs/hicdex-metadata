Peacock has unmated skills to see and reflect the true intentions of the heart.\n\nIts plumage looking at you as sharp as the sharpest eyes, pierces you to the very soul.  When the peacock does a cartwheel, it reflects the deepest inner image, emotions and intentions into the interlocutor, making everything seem very clear for at least a moment. \n\n \nThis can be the best moment of your life as well as the worst depending on where your heart is at the time of the meeting.\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeSioR8aPTQk8biRDiq9axRU2LPQFJgE73Z7xmLn8u9AD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmedrkFKpA43YF2MSVwgCAWNvbicHUUKwc9sRHBzrcuwHf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeSioR8aPTQk8biRDiq9axRU2LPQFJgE73Z7xmLn8u9AD", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld", "bird", "peacock", "mirror"], "extra": {}}

This book consists of 15 photographic projects, united with a theme of spiritual photography. The book explores many topics and themes. The title Weeper grass sends a reader to a concept, taken from doukhoborism (spirit-wrestling), about spiritual fighting for freedom, love and kindness in pacifistic way, in my case, with art. This phenomenon, originated in 17th century Russia and Ukraine has almost vanished in modern world. The weeper grass grows against the flow of the water (way of life of those who chain people with injustice, violence, hatred, etc.), and is fighting for universal love and freedom. This book is my way to present this inner work and pray for the world.

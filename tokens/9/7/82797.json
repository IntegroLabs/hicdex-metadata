It was created during the winter of 2020 using an iPad, Apple Pencil, and Procreate. It was my 5th digital drawing using these tools.","tags":["sunnycrittenden","moongoddess","moongarden","foxglove","bleedinghearts","moonflowers","moon","2020","nightsky","stars"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmdwh1QTAy8K9GkfJWfbq8t2BXrXSskUj3gedvL9Yaou5o"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmdwh1QTAy8K9GkfJWfbq8t2BXrXSskUj3gedvL9Yaou5o","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

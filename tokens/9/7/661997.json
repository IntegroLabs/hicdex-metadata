The same creature may go by the name of konjich\u014d (\u91d1\u7fc5\u9ce5, lit. \"gold-winged bird\", Skr. supar\u1e47a).\n\nThe karura is said to be enormous,fire-breathing,and to feed on dragons/serpents,just as Garuda is the bane of N\u0101gas. Only a dragon who possesses a Buddhist talisman, or one who has converted to the Buddhist teaching, can escape unharmed from the Karura.Shumisen or Mount Meru is said to be its habitat.\n\nKarura is one of the proselytized and converted creatures recruited to form a guardian unit called the Hachibush\u016b (\u516b\u90e8\u8846, \"Devas of the Eight Classes\").", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRpNcyzstTUemKwHihUnGoy1HsVAfYAVJVP9wq7UoHpPS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPeT2bNPySNdGbLMnpZXc8TpiKNnc5UMqc7M75MrYLHcZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRpNcyzstTUemKwHihUnGoy1HsVAfYAVJVP9wq7UoHpPS", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cyLmFrjwBPZz1o22ogJavYJq7yqibfY6A"], "tags": ["karuragodillustrations"], "extra": {}}

I've mentioned it a few times that I am a big collector almost to the point of being considered a hoarder. I collect toys, knives, skate decks, books, art, all kinds of things that have to do with Graphic Design and of course kicks! I lean Nike for the most part but back in the day Adidas actually had a line of Skate shoes that only lasted for about a year. I was living in Atlanta at the time and there was an Adidas Originals store there and I bought just about every pair they released: Gazelles, Stan Smiths and Superstars, all skate shoes. Since then I've bought a couple pairs of Busenitz but in my opinion those original releases in the now defunct Adidas Skate line were some of the best. RIP.

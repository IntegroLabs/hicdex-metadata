By attaching the two probes to the leaves of a plant the device measures and identifies the tiny electrical current fluctuations the plant generates. These galvanic fluctuations are turned into midi notes and controls that can be read by synthesizers which allows the plant to tell about its environment and the changes that are going on around it. Live recordings, generative, real time, and no overdub. ***Collectors will get a full version 00:03:30 of audio-video with HD resolution.*** More info and details : bit.ly/fm_sound_plants","tags":["plant","soundart","nature","generative","installation","Newmediaart"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmYam3iic8KLLMVCXvmUQeKjZSSc7YuD9zZPeQKhdCCic1","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYam3iic8KLLMVCXvmUQeKjZSSc7YuD9zZPeQKhdCCic1","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTG4BqzmkJoj2aYXArU64vDsCHAcS75eqBjmWrU5mVeRL","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

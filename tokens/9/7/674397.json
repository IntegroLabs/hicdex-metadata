Similar but slightly different rice spirits mythologies are widespread among Indonesian ethnicities and also neighboring countries.\n\nThe mythology of Dewi Sri is native to Java and Sunda and Hinduism in the archipelago since early as the first century. She was equated with the Hindu goddess Shri Lakshmi, and often regarded as an incarnation or one of her manifestations. The goddess is also associated with wealth and prosperity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfMRNqnxGKpmfUTz9M3eMmkWJBoZeTRRfhNxGfFLeNB4u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUxzfLZfTbEo3ChGiCwCe6t1wWfTxJtY9CSN25sYRfXPs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfMRNqnxGKpmfUTz9M3eMmkWJBoZeTRRfhNxGfFLeNB4u", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1i96xcuq977irdWZain23XiBEj1ETg17sM"], "tags": ["illustration", "goddess", "Digitalpainting", "legend", "Mythology"], "extra": {}}

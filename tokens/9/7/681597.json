Especially when we have sweet dreams and they look real. We can fly, we can hide, we get a superpower in a dreamland, we get rich etc. But on the other hand, dreams (sweet/bad) can be signed to reality life. That's why sometimes a dream can be meaningful for other people.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYUntrPmCvfrj3kMTFFUoJdiyF2vHFXioSd67R1AEH8fw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcZN7N7aGELf6WWUZWpp2sSNWadqGqP8EnaH74Y9pP9fS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYUntrPmCvfrj3kMTFFUoJdiyF2vHFXioSd67R1AEH8fw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2RaBZis4KoQzKAqH3CJvHubfYo5pr26DZ7"], "tags": ["Blackandwhite", "photography", "sweetdreams", "oldman"], "extra": {}}

They aren’t rich influential landowners but poor people who barely earn enough to make ends meet. These are people who often sleep on an empty stomach while providing food to the others. And they are being crushed by a bill that will make it easier for big companies to exploit them. If you are reading this, please read up more about the farmer’s protests of India and help out by making their voices spread through every corner of the world.","tags":["Farm","Photograph","photography","picture","India","Himalayas","Landscape","Image","Digitalphotography","serene","nature","village","rural","road","street","hill","hills","mountain","Mountains"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmccSz5Cm5HWj1X6UnEv2n7T8zZdFX7UbN2Y6fG9UqDame"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmccSz5Cm5HWj1X6UnEv2n7T8zZdFX7UbN2Y6fG9UqDame","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 689197, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Golden Dragon", "description": "The golden dragon, who is a master of the skies, represents strength and fire. He has a golden color because he is related to the sun where he was born and will one day return to be reborn. \n\nHe was sent to this earth to protect it, from the sky he can have a global vision of the situation, but he can also land on earth to have a more local vision of the living beings. He recharges himself with the help of the sun and so he does not need to eat. He perches on the tops of the mountains to rest.\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSuKQecGo65E96oKGDndvdGAMza1K4dnDWDZi2ce7Vf2k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPX6Pak5qfgmBGkpTVPXxb8K5ENw3iK2fNmNZMhk5yuqT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSuKQecGo65E96oKGDndvdGAMza1K4dnDWDZi2ce7Vf2k", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["dragon", "dragons", "gold", "golden", "yellow", "ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld"], "extra": {}}

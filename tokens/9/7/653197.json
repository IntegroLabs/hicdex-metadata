Words come and go, some get caught on the sheets, on the windows, on the curtains and in the mornings when I wake up, as I'm stumbling towards the bathroom, I bump into a few and wonder; did I say that? apparently I did, and that's what my bedroom echo is there for, to remind me what I was and make me question myself once again. \n\nThe good thing is that when I clean, the words are gone, I am left with a blank sheet of paper to write on and as I realize the cycle of introspection that my words cause, I learn when to use them. \n\nThe echo of my room one day broke me and since then I have not been able to put together all the pieces to put myself together again, the task is long and complex, but I get tired of putting together pieces of something I was, I want to be something new.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbyb18g2EXJDgw13F1SgMVydKUa5P1BBzX1Zzk5bxGEQs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQyr4udnmd2RUChya39Vw2B3VnFCPi4ZECFNt5PB438dy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbyb18g2EXJDgw13F1SgMVydKUa5P1BBzX1Zzk5bxGEQs", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2VPrz6wQji1PEyHywYn8vw8vzHmZMdpzbx"], "tags": ["portrait", "photography", "femalephotographer", "nude", "art", "nft", "photo"], "extra": {}}

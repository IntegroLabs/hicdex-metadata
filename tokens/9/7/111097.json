She wears a fine veil embroidered with flower pistils. In order to make a better impression, a large wing is placed on the back of her head. She is well known as the Lady of Light. She is a great lover of the flowers, so she is no less worthy of being the queen of the flower. /// Dieda's family is now engaged in an uprising against an advanced artificial intelligence hornet drone cult that has destroyed her family. After the overthrow of a former government, Dieda, and her brother, were appointed by the Empress in order to restore the dignity of her family. She is in danger of death, with a large staff, branded weapons supplied by cyTek Armament Global, and two other items to hide from the enemies. She is no longer an advocate for the use of unmanned drones in the fields of agriculture and food production. She is also a member of a group of individuals called the Dragonfly Clan. A few of these groups have been established over the course of years in the areas of human agriculture, agriculture, and war. They have fought against all types of insects in the past, including insect larvae. Their mission is to eradicate these hornets from the field of agriculture.","tags":["GAN","AI","fantasy","scifi","aliens"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmQpvxPG4YbjAbkoTz3sVfjjXBQNWM4kreSgGDjyKVnr44"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQpvxPG4YbjAbkoTz3sVfjjXBQNWM4kreSgGDjyKVnr44","display_uri":"ipfs://QmPfTwkPSpJcUxnorhc2Bmqy4js8qXyPxJw21HCeWCSNPK","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

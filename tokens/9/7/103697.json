Now, half a century later, as I share these in a digital marketplace full of artists hawking their wares, I hope these photos remind us all of the humanity behind the transactions. This photo was taken in Kathmandu, Nepal, circa 1970.","tags":["photo","photography","vietnam","kathmandu","nepal","1970"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmaWtyG7gYakziWc2csZrSuUKMDCP77Wa5kbgQSaYa4qPP"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaWtyG7gYakziWc2csZrSuUKMDCP77Wa5kbgQSaYa4qPP","display_uri":"ipfs://QmS4baFzSUTMAVFPPdBNQScJyUstN3xnbv28VEpqDBmiM6","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

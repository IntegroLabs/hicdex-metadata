{"name": "Opsylloscope B", "description": "An oscilloscope, previously called an oscillograph, and informally known as a scope or o-scope, CRO (for cathode-ray oscilloscope), or DSO (for the more modern digital storage oscilloscope), is a type of electronic test instrument that graphically displays varying signal voltages, usually as a calibrated two-dimensional plot of one or more signals as a function of time. The displayed waveform can then be analyzed for properties such as amplitude, frequency, rise time, time interval, distortion, and others.", "tags": ["Opsylloscope", "Oscilloscope"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmRAzh76qBcJrXVXJKLKUuh5dNHrEpPVt1zsHgLYpzJfjh", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmRAzh76qBcJrXVXJKLKUuh5dNHrEpPVt1zsHgLYpzJfjh", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1P47TPFseHKmBnM1ZxDZS3skUUYL5DziKm"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRAzh76qBcJrXVXJKLKUuh5dNHrEpPVt1zsHgLYpzJfjh", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

{"name": "Quasi-Rothko", "description": "In 2005 I took a series of photos in very low light with long (several-second) exposures, primarily of brightly-colored items in my friend's apartment downtown Chicago. I punched up the contrast and exposure a bit in post. These abstract expressionist photo \"paintings\" were my favorite of the set. I like that this one reminds me of one of my favorite painters: Rothko.", "tags": ["photo", "photography", "abstract", "abstractexpressionism", "expressionist", "colorfield"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmNWn1Y92MBAZMJaZsXXbbvVa8LkpdWFfcwGWMYnTGHdAU", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmR7mYxVM52jg4ANdb27ewHSUejqzqgFpAmVhRbuTPn7R4", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1VuaZh9X3i1X52Tj154EzYB6qMBVNuTuDe"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNWn1Y92MBAZMJaZsXXbbvVa8LkpdWFfcwGWMYnTGHdAU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

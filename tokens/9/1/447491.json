SYMBIOSIS)", "description": "Symbiosis is the union of two elements of nature, man and divine, it is the moment when they integrate and recognize each other as part of each other. There is a light above, another light below and an expansion path between one and the other governed by a force energy that amplifies the signs of life, seeking to stimulate within all beings a way to enhance the sensitivity of things, the intuition. Colors work on consciousness and its expansion that develops within us through contrasts, light and shadow, nature, sun and moon, sea, forests, high conversations heal feelings that are not good because through the retina of the other I can perceive myself and further expand my awareness.\n\nYear: 2020 | Technique: Digital art made in ProCreate\n\nThis artwork is from a limited edition of 20 prints\nPrinted in UltraChrome HDx mineral pigment - Epson\n420x594mm Hahnem\u00fchle Museum Etching 350g\nRafael Prado - Brazil - 2020\n\n1565x2132pixels | .jpg | 92dpi | 2.03MB\n\nThis art is part of a collection of 4 works released by Gallery Visionariom Art.\nThis NFT was generated as a gift from a physical work.\nwww.visionariom.com\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWLbATLyxCbo8KEJaV9hYYV7XpnWWC27cP7YERiAYrumC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYBKDBFCJcs492t4WepKTMRLziBSiCEeP144q6BdwkXCb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWLbATLyxCbo8KEJaV9hYYV7XpnWWC27cP7YERiAYrumC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SLM8vVCZBW6qHQgBb1EqPPZXhSVxyQpse"], "tags": ["rafaelprado", "brazil", "sane", "visionariom", "visionariomgallery", "obrjkt", "psychedelic", "nftpsychedelic"], "extra": {}}

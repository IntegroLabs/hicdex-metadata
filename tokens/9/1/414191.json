Bridges discovered this green stone in Tanzania.\n\nIt took 7 years before this \u201cgrossular garnet\u201d was renamed Tsavorite.\n\nDespite the commercial efforts of the time, tsavorite remained for a long time a stone little known to the general public. Today it is very appreciated for its great transparency and its shades of meadow green\n\n\nArtwork make with AI // MetaTsavorite // Created by Roman Guillermo // 10.10.2021 // romanguillermo.tez", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRHHWUe5gvo2XveYMH9qYGAPuBWX7uAmGbkmiKeuJJoLq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRHHWUe5gvo2XveYMH9qYGAPuBWX7uAmGbkmiKeuJJoLq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRHHWUe5gvo2XveYMH9qYGAPuBWX7uAmGbkmiKeuJJoLq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1RUEhqJV6SKcr59vZWoR47iW45EUnDavoH"], "tags": ["abstract", "ai", "digitalart", "colors", "gems", "topaz", "generativeart", "artwork"], "extra": {}}

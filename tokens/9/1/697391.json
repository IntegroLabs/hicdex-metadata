{"__version": 1, "token_id": 697391, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Clash of the Titans", "description": "Clash of the Titans (Titanomachia) in Greek mythology is a series of battles that took place over ten years between the Titans and the gods of Olympus long before the existence of humans.\n\nThis great war aims to determine who will rule over the entire universe. This happened because Zeus and his siblings fought against Kronos, their father who had swallowed them because it was predicted that Kronos' power would be overthrown by his own son.\n\nIn the battle of Titanomachia, the young gods from Mount Olympus, led by Zeus, fought against the titans based on Mount Othris and led by Atlas.\n\nAfter going on for ten years, Zeus' side finally won. Zeus then imprisoned the Titans who fought him in Tartaros. While Atlas had to carry the earth on his shoulders.\n\nAs happened in this story, a person's greed will eventually become his own grave. We hope that this artwork can serve as a reminder for all of us not to be greedy in life. Suffice ourselves with what we have and be grateful, then our lives will be full of peace and not lead to a tragic downfall like Kronos. Cheers!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdCKeeWE6vBj11CrrPArRoJLZy8SKRBGijS3AJ4jhXqyp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRu7v56Jc9wNsqkqA16qaKwEvh3PoCndS8SSrekPrqkwk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdCKeeWE6vBj11CrrPArRoJLZy8SKRBGijS3AJ4jhXqyp", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1QokCJUUmJ9ZaahH96EADBYsqKYHnK1ZAT"], "tags": ["artwork", "digitalillustration", "darkart", "illustration", "surrealism", "mythology", "titanomachy", "dimeslab"], "extra": {}}

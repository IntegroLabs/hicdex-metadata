Due to their favorable location in the Mediterranean, the islands were coveted by many civilizations of the sea. \n\nAlong the entire Majorcan coast you can still find defensive towers, which once served to warn the population of the arrival of corsairs and pirates, and which today are fantastic viewpoints over the sea.\n\nThe castle was built in the Gothic style at the beginning of the 14th century, with an original circular base. Here, in addition to the old dependencies of the Kings of Mallorca, you can visit the Municipal Museum of History, a collection of classical sculpture and the cell of Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos.\n\nIt was built between 1300 and 1311 by order of King Jaime II of Mallorca as the residence of the kings of Mallorca and is one of the best examples of fortified civil \nand Gothic architecture in Mallorca. The castle has also been used as a refuge and prison throughout history.\n\nIts original design stands out, with a circular base, unique in Spain. It is structured around a central patio, also circular, with four large towers oriented to the four cardinal points.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYS5PxvgiRoA2h3YCPKMBEciZmCD1RrdiJ6wZyQvVu1nL", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdz29ptEWghBqHEcDHvq5w3Hs8f4uWVLAKG3owhZ7dRmV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYS5PxvgiRoA2h3YCPKMBEciZmCD1RrdiJ6wZyQvVu1nL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PMKvEvVoxycsXt7u8NpcbQy26AHgsMJox"], "tags": ["beach", "sea", "castell", "trip", "travel", "traveler", "enjoy", "life", "shot", "iphonex"], "extra": {}}

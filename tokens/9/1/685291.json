Let\u2019s start to turned out the rockets to spread out the flowers that people can enjoy when they are sad, cornered by the harshness of life \nand to be used by a poor man as a gift to his first blind date.\nLet\u2019s make this world as a play ground for little children that makes them feeling grateful to be a part of this world.\n\nLove is the answer to all the problem we\u2019ve got here. Love is the only cure that can place the humanity back above of all.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmczsYt9p2ma3q1MypxF9PxR1CFe4evCpaBUiXRuKDFLFd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSWW3nEfbPz6g8FTJnDMsxkW3JHReiFM5kxhYJW3c6Jev", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmczsYt9p2ma3q1MypxF9PxR1CFe4evCpaBUiXRuKDFLFd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XGCJXBCgfQHErL6Wzc5mDFLdeV4HRfSZ2"], "tags": ["Love", "Rocket", "Missile", "Stop", "Wars", "Message", "voxel", "peace", "smile", "happy", "fire", "free"], "extra": {}}

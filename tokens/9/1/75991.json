Russ lives downtown in Erie, PA. He asked me for a dollar the other day. I told him that I would trade him for a photograph and that if I made any money from it, I would find him and split it with him. Russ definitely doesn't think I'm comin back... The first $100 is for Russ. The next $100 I will keep for expenses. The rest will go to a local charity/mission/center of my choice.","tags":["Russ","Eskaton","art","Something","Strange","Charity","Homeless","Mission",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmUPz4WxUSppCuV81UC5Y8WZAE4AGDnreqESnVXBN1CX8F"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUPz4WxUSppCuV81UC5Y8WZAE4AGDnreqESnVXBN1CX8F","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

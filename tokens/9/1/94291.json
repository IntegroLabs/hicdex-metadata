When I took this shot back in the days and imported them to computer, I thought it was just not worth editing, but I was wrong. I was going through old photos and saw these and edited them again to remember the place I love and people I miss. This is 1st photo of \"Tokyo - Unvisited Streets\" series. Collector who collects all 4 will receive additional photo, and that will be the photo I haven't posted anywhere else(Through Tezos wallet). Please contact me directly whenever you collect all of them. / Format : JPEG / Size : 6000× 3243","tags":["Tokyo","Japan","Streetphotography","nightphotography","lofiaesthetic","cyberpunk","neonnoir","Night","Street"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmSVh7r622MkpYpDXLAfcqV2veXRZCuBpbPE2ewT9RgRvc"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSVh7r622MkpYpDXLAfcqV2veXRZCuBpbPE2ewT9RgRvc","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

When I took this shot back in the days and imported them to computer, I thought it was just not worth editing, but I was wrong. I was going through old photos and saw these and edited them again to remember the place I love and people I miss. This is 1st photo of \"Tokyo - Unvisited Streets\" series. Collector who collects all 4 will receive additional photo, and that will be the photo I haven't posted anywhere else(Through Tezos wallet). Please contact me directly whenever you collect all of them. / Format : JPEG / Size : 6000\u00d7\u200a3243", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSVh7r622MkpYpDXLAfcqV2veXRZCuBpbPE2ewT9RgRvc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1UkivGHDvUXRPfUrsV8yMJNqwa2hx62yUn"], "tags": ["Tokyo", "Japan", "Streetphotography", "nightphotography", "lofiaesthetic", "cyberpunk", "neonnoir", "Night", "Street"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmSVh7r622MkpYpDXLAfcqV2veXRZCuBpbPE2ewT9RgRvc"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://Qmd2R7WzktD3bv72e9U14sHbxUMgfLjH4N3XLLzcaEvNNw"}, "supply": "10", "transfered": 10}

This shot was taken in my old workplace neighborhood. Actually it's a mosque car parking lot. Islamic culture here is different from The Middle East. The influence for design, architecture, fashion, food and so on is coming from native culture that blend in after muslim traders came to the country. When i saw this landscape at that mosque, i felt i already visited middle east because it's kinda had different feeling from the other mosque scenery in this country. And it's nice to spend quite long time here enjoying the vibes, like almost everyday in two years!\n\n|About Journey to The Unexplored|\n\nExplore can be anything. It can be places, feelings, someone, thoughts, literally anything. This is a collection of my photographs that i captured during the darkest time and post-darkest time of my life. Exploring places is just metaphor for guide us to a deeper meaning.\n\nShots on 35mm using Fujica M1 analog camera taken in Indonesia.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma7Z7LnQhd4oC9JNNcW5arBfE7dDYwB5EsuHUc6Y3SkXS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXiRXWoEX6T1YXWAodPQ2uGFxPdCL5a4akuqKB8frQp3H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma7Z7LnQhd4oC9JNNcW5arBfE7dDYwB5EsuHUc6Y3SkXS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hTndxxhNiEgMjXGi3WbvR6iz2NpCFRtcJ"], "tags": ["analog", "photography", "35mm", "filmcamera", "humaninterest"], "extra": {}}

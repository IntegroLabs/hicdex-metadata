Please Stand By, They\u2019re Burning My Books. Book banning has increased at unprecedented rates in the past 6 months in schools across America, with some local Virginia politicians calling for books to be burned. The books mostly focused on racial  gender and sexual identity, as well as racial and religious injustice throughout history, are being banned in hopes of keeping the children as close minded as the adults enacting the laws. The books include Pulitzer Prize winning graphic novel Maus, a graphic novel used in many schools that teaches about the horrors of the holocaust, as well as Michelle Obama\u2019s autobiography. While politicians are using this culture war as an easy way to score points with its constituent base, in the process they are holding down the youth of America instead of raising them up. We should be pushing for an expansive all encompassing education for our children, only then will we as a society become better.

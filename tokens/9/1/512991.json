Please Stand By, While The Techno Elite Save Us. A recent opinion article in the NY Times labeled the current state of the US economy as Muskism, an extreme form of capitalism, where \u201cstock prices are driven less by earnings than by fantasies from science fiction.\u201d We see this with Jeff Bezos and his Blue Origin company, Elon Musks multiple different ventures from space exploration to the reconstruction of land travel\nor even Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pivot to focus on building a meta verse. These companies driven in part by science fiction stories meant to condemn this exact form of capitalism, believe they are the only ones who can save the world from itself and therefore should be afforded to do what they please when they please. \u201cMuskism has origins in Silicon Valley of the 1990\u2019s\u2026As the gap between the rich and the poor grew wider and wider, the claims of silicon valley start-ups became more and more grandiose. Google opened an R&D division called X, whose aim is \u201cto solve some of the world\u2019s hardest problems.\u201d It has since evolved into a mission to save the entire planet from mysterious \u201cexistential\u201d risks such as the extinction of humanity. Yet while they claimed in public to be trying to save the world, they continued to accrue more and more wealth leaving Musk and Bezos battling for the world's richest person position, because in their minds the only ones who could save humanity from extinction, was the techno billionaire class they were a part of. This inflated sense of ego is a direct result of capitalism gone wrong, where individuals have been allowed to accrue such unearthly sums of wealth that in 2017 it was found the top 3 richest Americans, held more wealth than the ENTIRE bottom 50% of the country. 3 People held more wealth than millions of people combined. And it\u2019s only gotten worse since then. While many of the risks these individuals are concerned about need to be addressed, we are a world of almost 8 billion people, we should never entrust 5 rich individuals to be the sole decision makers on issues that affect all of humanity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUBunUFgmUE1vriSt9Dtegu9di8iAkHEhBe4kH7BEwicX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR8vBv4bGyGTCGNJYRSbXYsfTtbcu7Ve9h4PFEPHwjwqp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUBunUFgmUE1vriSt9Dtegu9di8iAkHEhBe4kH7BEwicX", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}

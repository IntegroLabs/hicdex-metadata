{"__version": 1, "token_id": 672391, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "CHARLATANS", "description": "Speaking of charades, the art world has many practitioners, otherwise known as charlatans. As much as I Holden Caulfield myself into a corner by pointing fingers at other nameless artists, I acknowledge that this is part of the veritable forest that is the art world. We are all humans. Humans lie and cheat. There is an art within a charlatan, literally and figuratively. The art of grifting, seduction, schmoozing, playing upon subjective intelligence, presenting curated narratives are amongst some of the reasons. Also, when I point a finger, there are 3 pointing right back to me. Who am I to say someone is a charlatan? Who is to say someone can't say I'm a charlatan? I mean technically, I lived in Charlotte for about a year making me a Charlottean. (Wait, what's that? This just in from the audience...\"Andrew, that's pronounced Char-lot-tea-an, not Char-la-tan. Your awful Dad puns are killing us!\") Ahhhh...success again! I can sleep easy knowing I made about 10 people close the book and shake their heads. If you made if this far in the book, 1. Thank you. 2. You've got an open mind. 3. You're not afraid of seeing the world from a different perspective. 4. You have a lot of time on your hands.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmabhD2GyrxVnYW2CzzEMUEQk3v1nTNFtEMXYtNhjGeyBe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTYdBYGi19jK2qfJmLwGvPVn4y7M3iNho7XwA11mbCCt5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmabhD2GyrxVnYW2CzzEMUEQk3v1nTNFtEMXYtNhjGeyBe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

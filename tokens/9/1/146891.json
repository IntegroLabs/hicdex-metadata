This is one of a series of twelve statements developed in response to the first Low Carbon Design Institute residency.

The take and the give. @joz_freeman", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPkju25Qo188qAdmMJZ9onQeR5xnqUPmoHUUmnsDKZzH5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPkju25Qo188qAdmMJZ9onQeR5xnqUPmoHUUmnsDKZzH5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPkju25Qo188qAdmMJZ9onQeR5xnqUPmoHUUmnsDKZzH5", "mimeType": "image/svg+xml"}], "creators": ["tz1Ww1SbEyjeNUkUzTrhgEuiTjaVBJD21kDx"], "tags": ["Lettinggo", "energy", "text", "collect", "climate", "release", "context", "convenience", "locdi"], "extra": {}}

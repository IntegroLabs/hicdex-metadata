She is a former medic in the military and after losing her arm in the war, she thought that she would no longer be able to continue on as a medic. To her surprise, while in recovery, she began to see little beings in need... there were spirits, sprites and magical creatures who needed help and only she could see them and make contact with them. She had a new arm which no one else could see - a \"Ghost Arm\". Now that she is healed, Yo has become a full-time medic for the magical creatures and spirits in need.\n\nOriginally painted w/mixed media on birch panel - this version has slight digital enhancements.\n\n1200 px x 1200 px at 300 dpi", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdMGqLSmaQnj6fgUWsuaDgcrKHJ6DWdichVQs6V3P3HGJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbdnVTm7jhuhwHoCbPKQPapuFvib7eh9BpjDcBujzTBkn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdMGqLSmaQnj6fgUWsuaDgcrKHJ6DWdichVQs6V3P3HGJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QcZZQz2jSV8PK9E9HtzFUpWhHG4GgLq2w"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

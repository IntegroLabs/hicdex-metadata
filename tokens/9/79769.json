The tokens available here on portal correspond to the first two episodes of the series, as well as individual \"trading cards\" of its cast members. This work also joins the Denglerian discourse on art and the market.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRJYup3dToCYN1FpYMPsMhA5t3F3qy3ybXD4PSPymydtv","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1P9Wh88vHWgwmBE1EKWnmuF9FyEKNL1kf1"],"tags":[".gif","gold","verenadengler","AstridMeyerfeldt","TheGalleristandtheBeautifulAnti-Capitalist"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmRJYup3dToCYN1FpYMPsMhA5t3F3qy3ybXD4PSPymydtv"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmXQQ6CMnaW44yJjRieVGDLsdYGEFU1mvePompzLCbcvT6"},"supply":"1","transfered":1}

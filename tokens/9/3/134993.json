Please Stand By And Carry On.  Keep Calm And Carry On was a wartime motivational poster produced during World War 2 in England.  In anticipation of mass air attacks on major cities it was meant to raise the public morale.  I decided upon using the phrase Please Stand By during the height of COVID because I felt people were so anxious to push things \"back to normal\" that their impatience was threatening humanity. Please Stand By And Carry On is a signal to show patience and persevere.  There is light at the end of the tunnel if we can follow the motto.","tags":["art","digital","digitalart","digitalart","color","colorpalette","colorpalette","colorpalettes","colorpalettes","glitch","glitchart","glitchart","TV","telvision"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmUFU4dGxs2D1P2dpKDaVF8XUMTTro8LatuEF3R61C6JB5","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUFU4dGxs2D1P2dpKDaVF8XUMTTro8LatuEF3R61C6JB5","display_uri":"ipfs://QmV3H9p1pVeNmB1e7jG32AvdzcGhctJkd8jsMc2FGPLxPT","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

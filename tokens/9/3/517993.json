As long as you want on rendering (more time -> better)\nSecrets: There's a maths addon that has mandelbulb as a preset to save implementing it fro scratch\nComments: Really cool! I'd love to mess with this more. BUT I do see a LOT of pieces that are just taking someone else's fractal code/software, running it, tweaking colours a bit and calling it art. \nWish I could render this in high quality with Cycles but alas my poor laptop would be working for weeks. Also, the power just went out so EVEE at lower quality is the best I can do :)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdAihm3EaAdgqcmkpjFMbkyExhcKpFfPqZnB2UuBB2qPe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPsUqba1nPTKcBZ34zBscn64b2hKrcSuPRvFMg48Dzce8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdAihm3EaAdgqcmkpjFMbkyExhcKpFfPqZnB2UuBB2qPe", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1UsG8NJtNCAtSkJLN4a1zcgFd9yzfpGeQZ"], "tags": ["fractal", "blender", "evee", "clouds"], "extra": {}}

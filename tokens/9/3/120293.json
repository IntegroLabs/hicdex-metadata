Primarily stories of spirituality, divinity, evil, loss, mortality, redemption, and love. It was starting with the two characters on the cover. They were a spin of the story of Cain and Abel. I worked out several ideas/sketches as we went along. The rest of the stories, especially ‘Carry Me Down’ based on a mother and daughter relationship, just took shape and claimed their place on the artwork. All borne out of my love for great LP covers from the late 60s and 70s. The composition of spiritual, dramatic landscape and imaginative worlds. The Cheating Sons album is available for download worldwide at most music sites. The album is available on Bandcamp. https://cheatingsons.bandcamp.com/album/cheating-sons-2","tags":["artwork","divineart","digitalart","spiritualart","albumartwork","albumcoverart"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmY8aPmjwsF3UaUqPU94Nk315WcJ2YCrhVEcw4ibkRwESQ","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmY8aPmjwsF3UaUqPU94Nk315WcJ2YCrhVEcw4ibkRwESQ","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNQv9e5Y55WupnyASTWV2o51Ek75DbtE736bCXRgdJtJB","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

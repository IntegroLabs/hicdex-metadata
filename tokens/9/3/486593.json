The world is rapidly changing and with time it is increasingly difficult to predict what may happen.\nHowever, it is generally accepted that the human society follows a cyclical path of development. There are periods where there are \"revolutions\" in art, culture and philosophy which change the face of the world.\nBut in the end, we always go back to a certain level of stability. This is because humans are conservative and resistant to change.\nPeople are very attached to the way of life they have known. They want things to remain as they were, despite the fact that there is no reason why this should be so.\nAnd this is the real problem with George Orwell's book. The world that he imagined was a totalitarian regime where everyone lived in fear and constant surveillance.\nI am not saying that things will never get to this point. However, it is unlikely that the human society will ever get completely there.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX7sEnbdSXdrMe3aNcDiM49n7xNpsFgu3wLRHyDgwU4qZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYZd95s5wDNojdXAEZzZ14xssrjZyVMdZcx575T57LYZs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX7sEnbdSXdrMe3aNcDiM49n7xNpsFgu3wLRHyDgwU4qZ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1c4F7u1PqjdqD1uiVbhx8mrfJ1YjMpLUWG"], "tags": ["planet", "geometry", "abstract", "cosmos", "digitalart", "energy", "space", "stars", "technospiritual", "everythingisconnected", "chaotica", "fractal", "fractalart", "mandala", "symmetry", "animation", "anim", "loop", "moving", ""], "extra": {}}

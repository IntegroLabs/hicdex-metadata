We are someone who can helped ourselves. It sounds so difficult but with a big willing to continue life, we can seek for help from the others. But the first priority is ourselves, our life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRKobqjf9a18vDN7VYobh8TCszS3EZ6hZicGXgVWjo6JR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRnhqNqPy9fd7PvCFgh2AQWiYS6k9Vn3HUGvFhjBz6yb2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRKobqjf9a18vDN7VYobh8TCszS3EZ6hZicGXgVWjo6JR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2VNE3nXEtcf4bMtEY7fnXz14WntZDjHooC"], "tags": ["Illustration", "gouache"], "extra": {}}

Depending on the context sticking out your tongue can mean many things. Some even cary their heart on the tongue...depending on what you say the tongue is either soft like a feather or sharp as a knife that cuts deep. The tongue also is your taste and can bring you joy or disgust with just a single drop. Embrace your tongue! When i start spirit paintings i dont know what they will look like in the end, i let the present energy flow thru me and guide every stroke, every line for it to be visualized. www.oibelart.com Twitter: @oibel1","tags":["OibelArt","Oibel","ContemporaryArt","Spirit","Tongue","VisualEnergy","Energy",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmQGnfo94Ne5ww1sWjm8gDgRgWg9fjDArekTNGUYL5RPax"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQGnfo94Ne5ww1sWjm8gDgRgWg9fjDArekTNGUYL5RPax","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

I am a dreamer female artist who lives in Brazil. My biggest dream is to live through my art and my creativity, and also to help make the world a fairer place for people and animals. If all goes well, I even intend to create shelters that are cozy and heavenly for abandoned or needy animals.\nI am currently in college, studying Visual Arts. I also love writing and playing the piano. I love animals a lot, including dinosaurs and the mythical ones like dragons.\nMy Twitter account: @danihp_art\nMy Instagram art account: @dani_hp_art", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUfgD9qB5z1FwXmfzC8z8JErJyR4ii9d9mWtKcJSwbwEZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPdGdqghW1kcU45HNXM8vt4vRGPyuzn8U6nGdr8mn5JKk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUfgD9qB5z1FwXmfzC8z8JErJyR4ii9d9mWtKcJSwbwEZ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MnL9oSz51vjrnFNt3oF3NQ6mfm6UoeSzQ"], "tags": ["animal", "colorful", "blue", "dream", "mandala", "art", "artwork", "arts", "deer", "animals", "drawing", "illustration", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}

Well for one, the word itself can be broken down to it's syllables O P M. More importantly, for centuries and millennia, opium was (and still is) harvested and used for medical purposes, like pain management. It's been made into drugs such as: morphine and it's much stronger chemical cousin, heroin, Back-in-the-day, the traditional method of extraction of the inner \"latex\" from the immature poppy seed pods was by scratching or scoring. The latex leaks out a sticky residue that when dried is scrapped off and collected and ready to be processed further. So not only is the word OPIUM reduced to OPM, but the the raw material within the poppy plant itself is then reduced to down to it's core chemicals for consumption.

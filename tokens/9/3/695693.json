This model shows the viral surface (blue) and the spike proteins studded proportionally to the right size and shape. These proteins are essential for SARS-CoV-2 to attach to human cells and infect them. Here, the spike proteins are represented in their open, active form (orange) that\u2019s capable of attaching to a human cell, as well as in their closed, inactive form (red).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTtndChSEN6Udo7bY12hLzeLHWtxMnWuxe6Xn8hUdTw1i", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNczhBfbSZqMKvqYazEgzRsLnmYwTsovvcrZR6phgsfQ4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTtndChSEN6Udo7bY12hLzeLHWtxMnWuxe6Xn8hUdTw1i", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SfVmQxpNNahw4ZRxn3wjyKyAZxtK7QQKB"], "tags": ["covid"], "extra": {}}

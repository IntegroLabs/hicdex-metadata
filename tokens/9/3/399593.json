{"__version": 1, "token_id": 399593, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Addictive Passion", "description": "This artwork shows a female laying on the floor with a tablet in her hand. She represents the passion she has to (in my world) the art and technology. The tablet represents the addiction but nobody knows if its good or bad. For her its good and she doesnt care what others think, which is pictured by the large towl over her body. On the other hand, in the background there is a statue that gives her reproachful looks. She doesnt understand the addiction and for her world its something bad. \n\nThere will always be someone that doesnt uderstand what you do or belive in, so dont think to much and live like you want.\n\nCreated in Cinema 4D and rendered in Octane. Edited in Photoshop.\n\nSize: 4000 x 4000", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYWf24AUp4RjGz2kDbprVCjtWYUzg1WdHLtjHGThaE8hd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPsBCLMoqekrc1NnP6tR6DbLA8tYxFqb1HiRrmPuYdz7p", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYWf24AUp4RjGz2kDbprVCjtWYUzg1WdHLtjHGThaE8hd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dCtadJBXNMe8hs8BNAGagNvb7zUCk4zFY"], "tags": ["Addiction", "Passion", "Female", "Body", "Statue", "Status", "3Dart", "meaning", ""], "extra": {}}

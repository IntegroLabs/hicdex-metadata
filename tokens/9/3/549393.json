{"__version": 1, "token_id": 549393, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Sting of Scorpion", "description": "Scorpio is one of the most misunderstood signs of the zodiac. Because of its incredible passion and power, Scorpio is often mistaken for a fire sign. In fact, Scorpio is a water sign that derives its strength from the psychic, emotional realm. Like fellow water signs, Cancer and Pisces, Scorpio is extremely clairvoyant and intuitive.\nWhat makes this water sign unique is its distinctive venomous sting. Like their celestial spirit animal, the scorpion, Scorpios lie in wait and strike when least expected. Life is a game of chess for these calculating water signs, who are constantly plotting several steps ahead in order to orchestrate an eventual checkmate. This doesn't mean their intentions are necessarily nefarious. Scorpios simply know what they want and aren't afraid to work hard and play the long game to get it.\nWater Sign", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf7bU8W9cZ5rD1SNXV1A9MdFFka1dNjjYTf9tp2nY41s6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeZHqqQFaYHbPBBF8J6wLGZYUXk1tRNem42pTpU7QiA15", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf7bU8W9cZ5rD1SNXV1A9MdFFka1dNjjYTf9tp2nY41s6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1S3J7kuYFho5QyhZ7czyDmoR8sU1nvGzMM"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

It is usually the legendary Super Angulon 21mm f4 lens and black and white film that I use. With this setup, I generally shoot landscapes and cityscapes in a contemplative style. A JPEG derived from a negative result using a digital camera.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXRCcCumRXKvki8RtMASLotnjFNbdMaf6kRjeQRsd2bhr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbPaBoozPYQXf5uHozrJDiTsKv9pYqiJv4vDhYDSWc3Cz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXRCcCumRXKvki8RtMASLotnjFNbdMaf6kRjeQRsd2bhr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2VSQin43os5gHDGBgscBkEkpRYAEfxEUGh"], "tags": ["Nftphotography", "photography", "fineartphotography", "bw", "photography", "analogue", "analogphotography", "blackandwhite", "analog"], "extra": {}}

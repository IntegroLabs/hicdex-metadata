Take my hand and let's walk this path together no matter what. \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTFshv3HuMh5x9wkDqsMYiM7yQq4kyqsxWwULhCTNgCQn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRifKSqpMKmMaWhE6ar3Zp2sutVr6fVeyTPGHnqBWvk9o", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTFshv3HuMh5x9wkDqsMYiM7yQq4kyqsxWwULhCTNgCQn", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1iiZVjkjh887kZ5rqRQXfRHZgP9VbJKg1d"], "tags": ["art", "abstract", "nft", "colletible", "collector", "community", "paint", "hicetnunc", "objkt", "collection"], "extra": {}}

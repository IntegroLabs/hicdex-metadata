Also related to Shri Shmashana Adhipati, they are enlightened deities categorized as 'Protectors of Wisdom'.  In Tibetan culture Citipati skull masks are worn by monks who perform the Cham Dance during religious festivals. This day commemorates the Birth, Enlightenment and Parinirvana of Buddha. It is the most auspicious day of the year. A Cham dance performed that day commemorates Buddha and Dharma.  Another important function of Cham Dance is to pray for a peaceful world, to protect all living beings from demons. It is a symbolic offering to the Bodhisattva to eliminate all suffering and worry and bring joy and happiness.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPsekVAUL1JxGXYbmUqieWyocs8c2TVe28JJe9B6fhF1V", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPsekVAUL1JxGXYbmUqieWyocs8c2TVe28JJe9B6fhF1V", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPsekVAUL1JxGXYbmUqieWyocs8c2TVe28JJe9B6fhF1V", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1T2EuVzezzTScPiZbERWfKQHNMvrSRvLVy"], "tags": ["c0d3", "psychedelic", "surrealism", "OM", "buddhism", "meditation", "spiritual", "esoteric", "mystic", "alchemy", "trippy", "hallucinogenic", "transmutation", "portal", "2D", "animation"], "extra": {}}

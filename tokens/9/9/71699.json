I’m so excited, i did this piece with crayon, markers, a little bit of ink, some details with pencil, basically everything that was in the reach of my hand at the moment, i wanted to play a little with coloring and ended up reaching deep in my mind and finding this creatures who are bathing in the sun. I like this piece very much and i’m happy that they can live in the internet now. Please use sunscreen.

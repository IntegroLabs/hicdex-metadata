They all started popping out one by one and I knew that I had been given the final go ahead artistically to turn this piece over on the roster of completed works.\nI like that some of the faces are very vague and take a little more time to seek out for the viewer to see.  I hope you enjoy my work. With Love \n~Mass Graven Image.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdDKoKn1CLhmX5jsdLDeS3kV6dMro1D3sLyMGGEoebRz5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR9vS4skLiDKbDjfRDVh1Fg3GYGQZya8BE7DQuVniNxnb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdDKoKn1CLhmX5jsdLDeS3kV6dMro1D3sLyMGGEoebRz5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LnavCNnCHhqnixzTK9xwwELdcnTtsDFro"], "tags": ["digital=illustration", "digital", "artwork", "colorful", "creatures"], "extra": {}}

They may believe they have a lack of control over their life or they may not be correctly balancing self-care with life’s demands. Emotional exhaustion affects a person’s mood and mental health. People may initially notice that they are feeling more cynical or pessimistic than usual.  They may lose their motivation to work, socialize, or perform simple tasks. Eventually, these feelings can become stronger and cause individuals to feel trapped or disconnected.","tags":["ART","DIGITALART","COMPOSITION","COLLECTIBLESS","NATURE","CONCEPTUALART","VISUALPOETRY","ECOART","PAINTING","PICTURES","GRAPHICS","ARTWORK","ARTMOVEMENT"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmVZcYTR75hgVxR8eJGnoWG929gQkLJwM1xNL283E1fd6r","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVZcYTR75hgVxR8eJGnoWG929gQkLJwM1xNL283E1fd6r","display_uri":"ipfs://QmWDLXezBgcuiiwXjXM1tE2J3UZqCp1CNt2SMaGtkxwnkv","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

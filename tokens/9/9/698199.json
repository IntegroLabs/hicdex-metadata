As a little child, she surprised everyone when she managed to save Neex, her bird and companion, from death after having suffered a ferocious attack, turning him into a cyborg and her most faithful companion. After a successful career in the brigade and having an excellent mission record, he was allowed to return to his home planet; Ramkyza, recently freed from the yoke of an invading civilization called the Yilmaz, who colonized the planet for centuries. Neerami needs to transmit all her knowledge of technology and robotics, in order to bring prosperity to such a punished planet. Right now Neerami and Neex are searching for the \u2018\u2019Codex Shiva\u2019\u2019, a memory that contains the information made by a wiseman of her people, whose ancestral knowledge is decisive for the development of his research of technology to improve the lives of his people and of all the people of the Union.\n\nSoundtrack By Gabriel Romero @OpacityLow", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUoWmQuPkUWavHkSZBskqqNP8Dkoxz5vr5aCFMS67mjgx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQowDbkWkqVs6Zd5GgKV8yWuETduVi4Mtwtqb5fhfA1nt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUoWmQuPkUWavHkSZBskqqNP8Dkoxz5vr5aCFMS67mjgx", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bF1c2dZPqtapqP4iCxitkrRfcjZnEiKzw"], "tags": ["future", "collection", "lonely", "hearts", "lonelyhearts", "animation", "character", "saga", "space", "love", "galactic", ""], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 148999, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Drugdress", "description": "\"Drugdress\" is a garment that I have made to measure, with the empty blister-packs of my medicines, accumulated over 3 years (two or three pills a day). I have only used the blister-packs of medicines consumed by me, most of them are Zyprexa and Lamictal, although there are also Orfidal and Escitalopram blister-packs. The medicines are my treatment for bipolar disorder, I have been taking this medicines since 2009, which have quite serious side effects. Some of the side effects than I suffer are: drowsiness, forgetfulness, weight gain, lack of concentration, restless legs, autolytic ideas and lack of balance. I made the dress as a way to make bipolar disorder visible, a witness of my continuous medication routine. Since 2009 I have met all kind of reactions to my disorder, some denialist. Wearing this dress may change the perception of the ignorant: make visible and destigmatize mental illness. I also demand improvements in the public services of psychiatry and psychology. Finally, patients need pharmaceutical companies to continue their research to create psychoactive drugs with fewer side effects.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVUyYJuQudgTJvN6kkX1jmfBcChHWTMzpnXKhBgyw9wgu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYL45XR9fewLydp4fVzzvFJmUGh7iBpimGx1gVjYiEqFb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVUyYJuQudgTJvN6kkX1jmfBcChHWTMzpnXKhBgyw9wgu", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Y3NtxmYDD8Vk2Ratqr8DuirjRsbDekY89"], "tags": ["drugs", "dress", "drugdress", "narcovestido", "catwalk", "metal", "model", "madrid", "spanish", "bipolar", "manic", "depressive", "psychotic"], "extra": {}}

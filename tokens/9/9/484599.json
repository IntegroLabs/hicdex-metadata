It is used as a recreational psychedelic drug and prepared by various cultures for ritual purposes as an entheogen. DMT has a rapid onset, intense effects, and a relatively short duration of action. For those reasons, DMT was known as the \"business trip\" during the 1960s, as a user could access the full depth of a psychedelic experience in considerably less time than with other substances. DMT can be inhaled, ingested, or injected and its effects depend on the dose, as well as the chosen mode of administration. DMT can produce vivid \u201cprojections\u201d of mystical experiences involving euphoria and dynamic hallucinations of geometric forms.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQN4HkadTFwBq1Cxaq8UNaKPDW341RK3DHmcKsXETbsKC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQN4HkadTFwBq1Cxaq8UNaKPDW341RK3DHmcKsXETbsKC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQN4HkadTFwBq1Cxaq8UNaKPDW341RK3DHmcKsXETbsKC", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "nft", "drugs", "collectryble"], "extra": {}}

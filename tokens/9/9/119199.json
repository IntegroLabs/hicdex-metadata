A personal, social and planetary healing that can be carried out according to lifestyles, ways of understanding existence on earth and rituals that are at the bottom of our collective memory. These ancient spiritual practices are key to its essence, but have to return from innovation, from the creation of new standards, not from imitation or apology from the past, take what essentially beneficial of these ancient cultures and reinvent it from the context of today.

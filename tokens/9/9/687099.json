{"__version": 1, "token_id": 687099, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Bad worship of Saint Bomber", "description": "We are on the verge of a possible World War 3, as simple as one country without measuring the consequences declared war on another and has been bombing non-stop for days, perhaps out of boredom, perhaps out of a need for expansion or supremacy, or simply because the territories it already possesses are not enough for it. One way or another, nothing justifies an attack playing with the fate of the world, nothing justifies playing with world intelligence and sovereignty, with the lives of civilians, and then blatantly justifying its invasion with something as sensitive as peace. How is it possible that Peace is synonymous with War? Unheard.\nWhile the world is running to avoid more bloodshed and tears, other countries boast of the warlike gesture and justify it by showing their double standards, without having a logical and human truth in their words and actions. Nothing, that now a military attack will be a religion, and its mastermind will become a holy grail of unilateral invasions.\nPain and death will be the way to place peace. Painful adoration of death. Hopefully humanity can in time avoid the catastrophes that are coming\u2026.\nTrue peace, infinite peace is what the world deserves, nothing justifies wars, nothing justifies the death and tears of many.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmea7TKab5FxFiEN3kmyBgNajQdscR73Nyh9hnPnnqNj27", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmedz3s1FYZxFtirDFiPUaoxbqHVdSBoRhiRACrusynMxs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmea7TKab5FxFiEN3kmyBgNajQdscR73Nyh9hnPnnqNj27", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QHAs2pi6ukHXN3snbeeUoD9KhkGrg3nyD"], "tags": ["Graphicart", "socialart", "lucentart", "graphicdesign", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}

Whereas the videos were based on sparse sampling of the space, these images are accumulations of many samples to try show the underlying probability distribution, similar to the flam3 algorithm used in electric sheep. Each image took 8+ hours to render on a GTX 1070, and contains ~4 billion seed points, which reached the limit of my 32 bit random number generator.

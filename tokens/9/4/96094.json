Rupi and Zel just went crazy (was it the moon effect?üåë) and grabbed all the moon toys that they could take and went straight to take a ‚Äúlook‚Äù on this very beautiful ring of Saturn.  I'm sure that these two are having the best time of their lives but I can't say the same for B√™‚Ä¶ He's not even a little bit happy with all this craziness. But for now, we can only enjoy this crazy adventure and hope that  the consequences to this playtime will not be that bad. Stay tuned for the next adventure, humans. A big meow to you all.üêæü™êüöÄ P.S.: this was a collab with @eternagnose who made this incredible soundtrack!

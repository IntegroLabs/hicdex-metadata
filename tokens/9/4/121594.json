{"name": "Like Olitski", "description": "In 2005 I took a series of photos in very low light with long (several-second) exposures, primarily of brightly-colored items in my friend's apartment downtown Chicago. I punched up the contrast and exposure a bit in post. These abstract expressionist photo \"paintings\" were my favorite of the set. I'm fond of how much this one looks like a Jules Olitski color field painting", "tags": ["photo", "photography", "abstract", "abstractexpressionism", "expressionist", "colorfield"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmSetrzMKDneQ2zKyLybtc64ohwv6WofEKZ3oa9eZfg7vT", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmTxN1fpfimrk4RQ4vDizCGyhBATQZ7uuATgzuNQjACyF7", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1VuaZh9X3i1X52Tj154EzYB6qMBVNuTuDe"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSetrzMKDneQ2zKyLybtc64ohwv6WofEKZ3oa9eZfg7vT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

Take my hand and let's walk this path together no matter what. \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcZ5pmfpDJ2ZneUvgqpM6vNApLSuYZerUEXqhuUmDvtAo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSGDvJgzXC5fN3GKW9XGhiuz3ypBFbcF5kjjb9ALfuN91", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcZ5pmfpDJ2ZneUvgqpM6vNApLSuYZerUEXqhuUmDvtAo", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iiZVjkjh887kZ5rqRQXfRHZgP9VbJKg1d"], "tags": ["art", "abstract", "nft", "colletible", "collector", "community", "paint", "hicetnunc", "objkt", "collection"], "extra": {}}

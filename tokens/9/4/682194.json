The nightingale agreed to come to the court, and when it sang before the emperor, he was so impressed that he did not allow the nightingale to return to the forest where it lived. However, some time later the emperor received a gift, a mechanical bird that imitated the sound of the real nightingale, and he lost interest in it and let it go. However, the mechanical bird eventually broke down and the Emperor became deathly ill shortly thereafter. As soon as the real nightingale heard about it, it returned to the palace and sang a beautiful song that restored him to health.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbVDVE3Y749Zdq4fHQa9eqsSEPBXy7hKaDwSuPw9eM5gX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbVDVE3Y749Zdq4fHQa9eqsSEPBXy7hKaDwSuPw9eM5gX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbVDVE3Y749Zdq4fHQa9eqsSEPBXy7hKaDwSuPw9eM5gX", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1gE7i3NjxuS65bGcVjBpmoMidjyy2xPR9S"], "tags": ["scii", "pixelart", "b&w", "blackandwhite", "gifart", "xeldajara", "fantasy", "nightingale"], "extra": {}}

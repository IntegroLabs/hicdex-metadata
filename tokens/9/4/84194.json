Come to farm.sebuh.net and check it out! The background image was designed by DoctaGonz and I currently Own this Tezos Rockstar NFT. $CRUNCH, $tDAO, $BEZOS, $BDVXP, $SEB, $hDAO, $FLAME LP Shares from Quipuswap.com can now be used at our new Liquidity Mines. The idea was sparked by Bender Labs $WRAP Liquidity Mining Programs. These Farms are currently setup to pay out 10,000 SEB To each Program over the course of 30 Days. Thats 0.23 SEB per Minute per Program. Thank you all for the encouragement and support in my little project. The main idea behind SEB is to increase the bankroll of Sebuh.net XTZ Baker to increase decentralization in the Tezos Network's Public Baker lineup. The other main goal is to increase new user adoption and participation in Tezos.

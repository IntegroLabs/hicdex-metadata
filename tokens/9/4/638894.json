Naked we are born and just like clothes we put on layers to fit in society; naked we have sex which is for me one of the greatest expressions of surrender and trust in human existence and I, among all this chaos that we were taught to call life, I write naked in my bathroom.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcWVm15PF44ZGBL2uUUVyeWuKHHnRa9hXjbUdKgHRJYPg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSxKpkEe9jR5dkQoUttxRqpzzxDTuAf15hkGoNyJst34A", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcWVm15PF44ZGBL2uUUVyeWuKHHnRa9hXjbUdKgHRJYPg", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2XXnWt5qvHmHv6ELQhmEpQwLeXj24F9YrZ"], "tags": ["pills", "anxiety", "depression", "poems", "poetry"], "extra": {}}

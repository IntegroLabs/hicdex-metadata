Trump said, \"Say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me.\" during a phone call on December 27th, 2020 to the acting attorney general at the time, Jeffrey A. Rosen, and his deputy, Richard P. Donoghue, on voter fraud claims that the department had thoroughly disproved. Words that will forever reverberate throughout history as the desperate demands of a dimwitted, twice impeached, one-term president, neo-Nazi sympathizer and all-around awful human being. Will this information surprise or change anyone's opinion of him? No, but the more truth that comes out...the more marginalized he and his supporters will be. He is the epitome the lowest form of politics; fearmongering.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaUfXNh3XtZikSrNcp7Kp9gJq6L5Qb2SKf1KLHMFH3FW9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVeXpG5NiuqBkCnYhMBxbFGxknbjy61AgaNTMzVP7GXM8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaUfXNh3XtZikSrNcp7Kp9gJq6L5Qb2SKf1KLHMFH3FW9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

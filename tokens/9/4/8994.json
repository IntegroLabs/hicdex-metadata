Every time one edition of this NFT is collected the image will get covered up with the new owner's wallet id. Note: This experimental NFT uses a call to an external API which at some point in the future might fail. This is the first patch to the original edition which has been adapted to the API changes that stopped version 1 (https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/8333) from working. It is sent for free to all owners of the original and cannot be bought directly. If you want to collect this work you have to buy the first edition. And whilst I cannot enforce this I ask anyone who sells either the first edition or this patch on the secondary market to also transfer the corresponding counterpart to the buyer.","tags":[],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/svg+xml","uri":"ipfs://QmdW5wvdw9wFvV23HLVja28CTWHyG26sZDTDeQnYeVQcR4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdW5wvdw9wFvV23HLVja28CTWHyG26sZDTDeQnYeVQcR4","display_uri":"ipfs://Qma6zHS99oPmABLHfNxjco6CS3vpurcSjSFuBUv4F7BiDm","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 486794, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "#15 Cannabicyclohexanol", "description": "Cannabicyclohexanol is a cannabinoid receptor agonist drug. It is used to make synthetic cannabis and may riskier than its non-synthetic counterpart. It is a bicyclic cannabinoid analog that avidly binds the CB1 receptor and shows high antinociceptive activity. Cannabicyclohexanol is ten-fold more potent than tetrahydrocannabinol in analgesic, motor depressant, anticonvulsant, and hypothermic effects. Cannabicyclohexanol has four enantiomers, which by analogy with other related cannabinoid compounds can be expected to have a widely varying affinity for cannabinoid receptors, and consequently will show considerable variation in potency.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXhQQFTGghfRS99RTeDSgtYMdgzaomrYmRbjiyb2PdFtD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXhQQFTGghfRS99RTeDSgtYMdgzaomrYmRbjiyb2PdFtD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXhQQFTGghfRS99RTeDSgtYMdgzaomrYmRbjiyb2PdFtD", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "drugs", "cannabicyclohexanol", "nft", "collectible"], "extra": {}}

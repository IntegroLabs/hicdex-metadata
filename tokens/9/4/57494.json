Mom and Dad are visiting California for their first time.  They were hesitant to come because of the rise in attacks on Asian elders, but felt confident after getting vaccinated.  We're going to visit Little Saigon after Dad drags us to the USS Midway Museum :) This is my first digital drawing ever, created using Windows 2.1 with Microsoft Paint in 1990.

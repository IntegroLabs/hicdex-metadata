{"__version": 1, "token_id": 676994, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LIVELINESS LOVELINESS LONELINESS", "description": "Here we have another short word ladder, but this time there is something unique that adds a certain layer of rarity. Even though the ladder is only 3 words in depth, it's 10 letters long. Not many 10 letter words work this way. On a technical level, we could remove 6 of these letters to reveal the core words: LIVE / LOVE / LONE, but that would be slightly underwhelming to look at. We want to see the interesting, the weird, the wild, and the unexpected. That's what makes these works so desirable to observe and/or own. We've also begun to experiment on the opacity of the words as a way to create further visual rarity. Notice how the image has a hazy quality to it on the left side and more focused on the right side. That haziness combined with the all-over design, sets this work apart from many of the words / phrases / sentences / etc. that were previously created. We will be experimenting a lot more with focus and wacky designs in future images.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUNfmFzJHHrixwi4U37MNoS5md42Vc6Ukh7xHfv1ku1MS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVcoXwKveX9KEvMfcVw4mjPE3BeH3bWqA7pw9iAtgTss7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUNfmFzJHHrixwi4U37MNoS5md42Vc6Ukh7xHfv1ku1MS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

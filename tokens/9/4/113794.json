In this series, Nana will be personifying herself as different Yōkai (Japanese spirits). Rokurokubi appear to be ordinary women. But at night their necks stretch and roam around scaring people. They are women cursed because their husband or father committed a sin, and the Gods punished them instead. Sometimes the women never realize they became Rokurokubi.","tags":["catdrawing","catillustration","cutecat","cat","illustration","digitalart","drawing","art","belprovedo","yokaiart"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmXnaZAsPF41AsW1ANQWcCRGmqiXaLgX6br324Y2GPGMMe"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXnaZAsPF41AsW1ANQWcCRGmqiXaLgX6br324Y2GPGMMe","display_uri":"ipfs://QmSRWfukuK8xxGRgKrFEtYyx1AZ8Sa7Cb2LabwyNq4uDmR","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

What Soul do you see captured in this art piece? Multiple photos were used to create it, but the show-stopper that latched a \"Soul\" onto it all had to have been a photo of multiple days worth of recommended daily protein of a thick steak being left on the counter to go bad and be thrown out by my roommate, who does this to some cut of cooked meat every day, but this time was a particularly infuriating example of wasted food for me. It's not just wasted food, it's wasted food when the person one room from where you're wasting this food has been going hungry and starving for days, can't afford what you're throwing out, and is too unhealthy to cook something like that.\n   I took the photo and made the art piece the day after they threatened my life, with fearing for my life very fresh on my mind, and I can vividly see the \"Soul\" of that threat in this art piece.\n\n   Part 3 of the \"Saint Amalgamations\" collection", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSBDNn2XAAsbhWjRiSsykkRfNCDuR3k5ku5PfxCd7wgey", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPPLDsHieSf6wx8sDEESxwyonzPJUh94uy8bXRamsH7tq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSBDNn2XAAsbhWjRiSsykkRfNCDuR3k5ku5PfxCd7wgey", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WSB79B4pMAqzsfhqox2FzCRkf15ybZ4GD"], "tags": ["steak", "posessed", "the", "soul", "of", "the", "saint", "violence", "threats", "deaththreats", "meat", "beef", "butcher", "Caesar", ""], "extra": {}}

This sketch was made using Grafx2, a modernized 256-color drawing app that is based off of legendary pixel art programs like DeluxePaintII and Brilliance. It can use colorcycling to animate images instead of frame-by-frame hand animation. This sketch was made back in 2012 and was first shared on the netart chat website dump.fm.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQUVzxhnmaWiKvzCGitvywLrgigbuq18VotNdBcoHrHuZ","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1UEF7YE3DguW1mxZWTpgoqfTJAqaQQYFac"],"tags":["OBJKT4OBJKT","gif","loop","pixelart","animation","netart","guccisoflosy","dump.fm"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmQUVzxhnmaWiKvzCGitvywLrgigbuq18VotNdBcoHrHuZ"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmWGZauDrGJzo7WP9w18nhs7VBExpnBe2D3WseZNYfAnZ5"},"supply":"100","transfered":198}

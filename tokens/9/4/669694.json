As a sneakerhead and a Star Wars fan the obvious no brainer pair of classic Dunk SB's are the Jedi's that released in 2004. I also happened to just watch the finale episode of Book of Boba Fett and despite the name my favorite parts of the series were the Mandalorian and Grogu episodes. The color palette on the Jedi's was definitely sampled from Yoda and now that Grogu is such a popular and lovable character I found it kismet that I dedicate todays design to a fellow sneakerhead on his birthday literally 2 hours after watching the culmination of The Book of Boba Fett.

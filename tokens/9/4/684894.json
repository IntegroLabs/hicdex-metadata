It was the second-most populous nation in the world. After many years denying Indian calls for independence, Britain finally agreed to full Indian independence in 1947. Indian independence was accompanied by a painful separation and the birth of a new nation \u2013 Pakistan. The separation led to painful incidences of sectarian violence and killing; it led to the migration of many millions of people who found themselves on the wrong side of the border. The independence of India also created a newly independent nation which claimed allegiance to neither the US or the Soviet Union \u2013 but a third way as Nehru called it. With economic development, India has the potential to become a new superpower in the coming century.\n\nModern aircraft 12 Annas For foreign air mail.

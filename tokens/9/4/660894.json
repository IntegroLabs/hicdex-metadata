I have hope that the conservation carried out by the local community can have a positive impact on the life of this rare animal in the long term. Here I hope that this community can access and collect for a form of support for the survival of endangered animals", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeeRPSHc4UZaeL6L1j9ydVgctA7uiKThhZj8qaBx8eH4S", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeeRPSHc4UZaeL6L1j9ydVgctA7uiKThhZj8qaBx8eH4S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeeRPSHc4UZaeL6L1j9ydVgctA7uiKThhZj8qaBx8eH4S", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2RW1DjnMkZLcFoUcGLZFpSuY2vJc71FSp9"], "tags": ["Moon", "leopard", "cat", "illustrations", "art"], "extra": {}}

The modern world has blurred the framework of these concepts so much that we cannot define these words. How much can you justify the inability to do something worthwhile, with the words \"Concept and idea\". Stop lying. Your inner world is ruled only by commerce and excitement. Face the truth, any exhibition is a banal advertisement. It has as much art and concept as the \"Pyaterochka\" sign outside your house. Stop shifting responsibility for meaning to the viewer. There is a small part of people who are able to understand or comprehend something. All others are just consumers. They consume your thoughts without even thinking about how absurd and unviable they are at times. Stop pulling something that is not and has never been in your works. If you think that art is freedom, freedom of thought and expression, then remember the words of Albert Camus: \"Truly free is only one who can afford not to lie.\"  Being honest with yourself and with the audience is what I consider to be the greatest art.  The work is a copy of the real object. Made of materials for outdoor advertising.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRpvjdD1WRD8WSfZVkCCndtgTFKAoHVt8dt9xNV4V6TNp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTcbmid8BHJjaYuXroPDzPCtkWt75Sux5Nw9T3EwZWGoH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRpvjdD1WRD8WSfZVkCCndtgTFKAoHVt8dt9xNV4V6TNp", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YFmqpYx46G8CNkLbdRaKNRHbw61Q2skjR"], "tags": ["calligraphy", "light"], "extra": {}}

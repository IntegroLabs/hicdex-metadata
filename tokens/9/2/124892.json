For this car build i decided to go with one of of my favourite super cars ever, the lamborghini murcielago SV. I loved how the car was so simple and clean and yet looked so aggressive and i wanted to keep that and stay true to the original design. Every single part of the car is modelled and textured from scratch in 3d down to the smallest screws on the engine, it took me about a month to finish the modelling and texturing part. 3 of my favourite shots of the Noire will be minted.","tags":["Noire","Automotive","cars","photorealism","3d","dark","sinister"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmRAD9SX4gjPYnGiFfNBDkLjwVczE34f3HziSHtrLvZG96","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRAD9SX4gjPYnGiFfNBDkLjwVczE34f3HziSHtrLvZG96","display_uri":"ipfs://QmQEnTdQk186Lp5TCbUFNzFPnAq1Yb4HusuTC8GmseULLH","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

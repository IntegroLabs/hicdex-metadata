At the beginning of Brazil's First Republic (1889-1930), the clandestine lottery called 'Animal Game', which still exists today, gained enormous popularity in Rio de Janeiro, the city of its origin, and soon in the whole of Brazil. The 'Animal Game' is a great subject to analyze the complex brazilian society. The illegality made the 'Animal Game' a topic with small numbers of research and investigation. This practice was almost banned  from intellectual reflections and viewed as proof of ignorance, lack of culture and the expression of our perennial inclination toward corruption and crime. This GIF is just a small attempt to analyze the many sides of underexplored themes.

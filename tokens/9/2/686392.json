We like money, so why do we throw it away? Do you want to have an entry of money? Recycle and win. The environment wins and you win. If NOT, all that plastic will go to the sea and in the sea the fauna will eat plastic particles and then we will eat those plastics when we feed on shellfish. Would you like to have plastic particles in your body? Or you would like to have money, a healthy body and a clean environment.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZJZR7Q9UjN4APbrFP61Jx7ners3b9VXK6JJPPRHfD4nu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbBBbpPvqPXwK8sAUxzJjkm5BxFw7aedADgQsmVJ7BVRG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZJZR7Q9UjN4APbrFP61Jx7ners3b9VXK6JJPPRHfD4nu", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SqydWaThuJnonGtApnEsoCEY6BUFnZNfj"], "tags": ["recycling", "environment", "awareness", "illustration", "nature", ""], "extra": {}}

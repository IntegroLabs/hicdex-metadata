Obviously, every Peppo has a temple. The most beautiful and most visited by tourists is the Temple of Intuition (1). Although it is known that the taste of a tourist is always under discussion. \n\nThis and several other temples have been built by the Obsi, but I will tell you more about this later because I don't want to beat around the bush, I just took a bath.\n\nIn the Temple of Intuition, they say, portals are opened. People from all over the country come to ask for a little of the intuitive gift that, it is known, is one of the most desired within the Morondangui population. Nobody wants to be rich or beautiful. Everyone wants to have a better intuition. \n\nOlga Muriel (2), the famous psychic and fortune teller, comes every year to give offerings to her favorite Peppo. It is said that she brings them freshly laundered clothes and bowls filled with lavender-scented fabric softener.\n\nThe Temple of Intuition was the first one built by Filomenus (3) and the last one he visited before his death. Some say that the King could sense his own death, but it is almost impossible to deceive destiny, especially if mirrors are involved. \n\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2022\n\n(1) Go to Objkt #415410\n(2) Go to Objkt #494047\n(3) Go to Objkt #439879\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUbk7SutLCAzrhmq48G29rStYCuv5eiLbF7KR7c3Szpnq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWp6wjeantfhPQf9pb44cXB6HaqdmEFw587M6VDAjbdQc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUbk7SutLCAzrhmq48G29rStYCuv5eiLbF7KR7c3Szpnq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["stamp", "Morondanga", "temple", "illustration", "2d", "character", "color"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 141092, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Buzandi", "description": "For Laurence. He loves Gorillas as I do. Buzandi is a western lowland gorilla born on December 30, 1991 in Melbourne, Australia and has been living at Hannover Adventure Zoo since September 18, 2001. His father was Matabo and his mother Bulu Betsy. His grandfather Jambo gained some fame when he rescued a small boy who fell into the enclosure in 1986.  Buzandi's biggest problem is visitors. He can't stand being stared at too much. He also doesn't like people who are dressed in black. Whether he then sees in them another gorilla who does not belong to the family or whether it has another reason, is not quite clear. However, it can be that he throws objects. What just comes into his hands. I can confirm this, he threw dirt at me a few times myself (I was lucky) and thank heavens he missed the camera. His last telephoto kill counter that I know of is 6.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVf8JiSw68XpQRAYX8dvvMyhXJ1iyDkfyajiJySF4v2MR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRxaRWyHGTMT4Etj6PNvCcKR8AbiStxq9kXvM98HS2gnQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVf8JiSw68XpQRAYX8dvvMyhXJ1iyDkfyajiJySF4v2MR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ahHn8hpmV5b9KjvHDNMjMijXV7URzT45x"], "tags": ["motherearth", "savetheplanet", "savethegorillas", "gorillas", "blackandwhitephotography"], "extra": {}}

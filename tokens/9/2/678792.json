The stomach is visible.[1] Many think that Sundel Bolong is the same as Kuntilanak, because in the myth, both of them are depicted with long hair and wearing a white dress. ).[1] The myth of the sundel bolong ghost has also become a common myth in Malaysia after being brought by immigrants from the archipelago.[1] Wikipedia", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQfBZQvvzpK4z9ahh6xduh4kiJHjSuPPyapMrX4h9fEEb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdFUGnJSMAe3GstcFAdN7NKpbtg5F1KNRzebLeuV48qyi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQfBZQvvzpK4z9ahh6xduh4kiJHjSuPPyapMrX4h9fEEb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2TpBZf71BS1iBLVdLJcvgVYVDueSLWGYFs"], "tags": ["Horror", "ghost", "woman"], "extra": {}}

My art seeks to capture the simultaneously symbiotic and tense relationship between order and chaos. Creation and destruction, are simultaneously flip sides of a coin and the same thing. In art, as in life, I seek encounters with what we most love and what we most fear.\n\nThanks for checking out my art, hope you have a great day.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbRpKm5JQ9BizqbThY4F5cgCpaYJdWV4D7nqSGo6Ta1kR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNcfxb5zy2LrWhvwumE2xbRrV78EN6hk5srD384PUW5ik", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbRpKm5JQ9BizqbThY4F5cgCpaYJdWV4D7nqSGo6Ta1kR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NtLeXgpZQbWsMTMsECahg6oR88tU7iCTq"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "abstract", "beautiful", "color", "colors", "expressionism", "chaoticexpressionism", "abstractexpressionism", "love", "chaoticneutral", "brightcolors"], "extra": {}}

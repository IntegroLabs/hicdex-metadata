I initiated the \"TieDye\" workshop program which applies it to t-shirts for children aged 6 to 15 years for 1 month. they were all very enthusiastic about joining my program, one thing I remember that resonates is the sound of children cheering as if celebrating their own success from making \"TieDye\" t-shirts. There is so much fun in the program that their parents join in on the celebrations, occasionally snapping photos of them. I pray that the Mojosongo village that I empower will become more independent and develop so that it can return to being a prosperous, just, and prosperous archipelagic nation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdUynkSyZAMzdubbN4EDjofQE87BtHCGqtYrb35RUJk8A", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYk3mRR6fjURmhRaZUP2mKZvB7Lg1wNbcXBCqBxJHcyRZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdUynkSyZAMzdubbN4EDjofQE87BtHCGqtYrb35RUJk8A", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2RogkyWRzVfBBbHypsy18amWtEkZRG6orx"], "tags": ["motion", "3d", "tiedye", "collage", "visualvideo", "audiovisual", "modelling", "animation", "playingcard", "anggerdana"], "extra": {}}

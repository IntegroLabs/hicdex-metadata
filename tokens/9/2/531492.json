{"__version": 1, "token_id": 531492, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "OH IS THIS CLOSE", "description": "OH IS THIS CLOSE, is an example of a sentence that literally defines itself. I suppose you can call is a meta sentence. What do you mean by \"meta sentence\" Andrew? Good question! When we break down the sentence visually to its core components, we can see from the left and right there are arrows pointing up to the word OH, indicating there is a focal point as well as unit of measurement to base what is close to what. By clarifying the words IS THIS CLOSE, we can use this as a verbal unit of measurement of being (this) close. There is more than one entendre at work here. We have the literal meaning and also an implied psychological measurement of the value of the art itself to the viewer, as in \"oh is this close\" to my heart? Or \"oh is this close\" to actually being art, but not hitting the mark?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPQ8fFjzvU6AXVWE5pFN6jCjiz1xYZgCJ7bEV1BTET1Dp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbJiPei8rcPig5uniccHG7oizZ3hwygbF3gvr2C1jbFkN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPQ8fFjzvU6AXVWE5pFN6jCjiz1xYZgCJ7bEV1BTET1Dp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

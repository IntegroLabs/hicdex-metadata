He is also referenced in Sikhism.\n\nRelative to similar concepts of such beings, Azrael holds a rather benevolent role as God's angel of death; he acts as a psychopomp, responsible for transporting the souls of the deceased after their death. Both in Islam and in Judaism, he is said to hold a scroll concerning the fate of mortals, recording and erasing their names at their birth and death, respectively.\n\nDepending on the perspective and precepts of the various religions in which he is a figure, he may also be portrayed as a resident of the Third Heaven, a division of heaven in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. \n\nIn Islam he is one of the four archangels, and is identified with the Quranic Malak al-Mawt (\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a, 'angel of death'), which corresponds with the Hebrew-language term Mal'akh ha-Maweth (\u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05da \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea) in Rabbinic literature. In Hebrew, Azrael translates to \"Angel of God\" or \"Help from God\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNYKuk2bTwn1bLzuEQj1KDiyqcG49VKmje5fTS4GDBmBW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQrgjpvYYGA828Tad1hegG7zrwbyXWw3DYV4ugmQPr9FK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNYKuk2bTwn1bLzuEQj1KDiyqcG49VKmje5fTS4GDBmBW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Zrzs1sC9BHbRwtDgFrNC4fkZ5cXMw83ch"], "tags": ["azrael", "angel", "dead", "codeart", "generativeart", "minimalart", "abstract", "mathart", "psychedelic", "minimal"], "extra": {}}

Our myopic views make us assume. Our assumptions make us judge. Our judgements make the world seem so much worse than it actually is. This is the third of a four part picture series in which Judgements_1, Judgements_2, Judgements_3 are a part of a bigger picture revealed in Judgements_4. The series is a quick reminder of resisting our judgements for what we may not understand as a part could make sense if only we knew the whole.","tags":["Judgements","parts","philosophy","nirvana","photo","art","picture","blackandwhite","guesstheobject"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmaFrBUEq6Gx4qF5dSxHgQnHgvH7LYKtoQZtV9zbqZ2SmF","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaFrBUEq6Gx4qF5dSxHgQnHgvH7LYKtoQZtV9zbqZ2SmF","display_uri":"ipfs://QmSxwGrTA6bNkjBmUXs95PpqXD3RKWuSs8rFxxtdufECu2","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Our judgements make the world seem so much worse than it actually is. This is the third of a four part picture series in which Judgements_1, Judgements_2, Judgements_3 are a part of a bigger picture revealed in Judgements_4. The series is a quick reminder of resisting our judgements for what we may not understand as a part could make sense if only we knew the whole.", "tags": ["Judgements", "parts", "philosophy", "nirvana", "photo", "art", "picture", "blackandwhite", "guesstheobject"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmaFrBUEq6Gx4qF5dSxHgQnHgvH7LYKtoQZtV9zbqZ2SmF", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmSxwGrTA6bNkjBmUXs95PpqXD3RKWuSs8rFxxtdufECu2", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1Mcox41eg23qSqjHrHwGjCZmRyiYsPxgjX"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaFrBUEq6Gx4qF5dSxHgQnHgvH7LYKtoQZtV9zbqZ2SmF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

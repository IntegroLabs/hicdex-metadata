This pitch is a higher frequency than that of the other whale species with migration patterns most closely resembling the 52-hertz whale's \u2013 the blue whale (10\u201339 Hz)or fin whale (20 Hz). Its call has been detected regularly in many locations since the late 1980s and appears to be the only individual emitting a whale call at this frequency. However, the whale itself has never been sighted, it has only been heard via hydrophones. It has been described as the \"world's loneliest whale\". - Wikipedia\n\nThis is a tribute to the \"world loneliest whale\" so it's a 1/1. \n\nOriginal composition & 3D animation.

The clear, cold 72 degree water escapes the pressure of the underground aquifer by releasing over 35 million gallons of water per day through a cavern in the porous limestone.  The water mixes with the red tannin dyed river water to create a spectacular display of red clouds, where wildlife can be seen darting through this ecotone. This area is believed to have the most abundant fresh water springs system on the planet.\n\nIn 2021, Nestle water bottling company, already established in the area, was permitted to pump an additional 1 million gallons per day from the spring, for an application fee of $115 and no additional costs. The entire springs system has experienced dramatic deterioration in the last 20 years and is on the precipice of total ecosystem collapse. Scuba divers, volunteers, environmentalists, ecologists, engineers and scientists are working to map the underground cave systems and create science based protections for these fragile ecosystems. The work is dangerous and the politics are difficult.\n\nKnow where your bottled water comes from.\n\nPhoto 2015 ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd5LV1eHDJczw8RtLTm6SRFwziYjLvyg5iDiYviienV3Q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQSekY35EaQcgNKcnDRgko3su4zcX4gMmkk5QGHb3g3UG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd5LV1eHDJczw8RtLTm6SRFwziYjLvyg5iDiYviienV3Q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i7m9Wt6sdDQt9kjTTLQDQCYuFZjZ8JVi4"], "tags": ["photography", "water", "springs", "florida", "nestle", "bottledwater"], "extra": {}}

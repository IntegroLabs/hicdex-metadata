Here, I invite you to engage in \u2018digital moral cleansing\u2019, an opportunity for you to \"wash away\" your immoral acts by purchasing an NFT that would \"clean\" your moral debt. For each of these dark sides, the profits of the NFT will go to a respective charity or research organization.\n\nFraud is the second out of the three pieces. Artist Impersonation is a vulnerability of the NFT space as anyone can mint anything as an NFT, without the consent of the original creator. To illustrate how easy it is to profit from someone's else work, this is a pdf of Bin Laden's diary.\n\nProceeds from this work will go to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPrsxR1zaY78i1jXKP9LZJSwpSizgvmeNPiS1r3hm92vQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQy8DyS3rxydNmz4SBew7dywKyMBxecwNJMQM5t4hkVGm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPrsxR1zaY78i1jXKP9LZJSwpSizgvmeNPiS1r3hm92vQ", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1WvgBFzqDLFNV5FehbsnPQvAJFPQkwtzxn"], "tags": ["Fraud", "artist", "impersonation", "moral", "cleansing"], "extra": {}}

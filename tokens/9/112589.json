Being smart isn't worth it in this economy. I free myself from intelligence. I cancel it. I declare intellectual bankruptcy. I had this conversation with myself yesterday. Intelligence is unsustainable. I am turning my brain off. I now identify as a dumb. I have decided and I accept that I am a dumb from this timeforth and forever. Maybe I'll be smart on weekends only, but that's just an option. I'm reclaiming my peace and truth by choosing the dumb. Let's go, dumb self.

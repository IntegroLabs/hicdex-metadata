Distinctive for their rich impasto, his exuberant on-the-spot studies include the Met\u2019s close-up vertical view of cypresses (49.30) and this majestic horizontal composition, which he illustrated in reed-pen drawings sent to his brother on July 2. Van Gogh regarded the present work as one of his \u201cbest\u201d summer landscapes and was prompted that September to make two studio renditions: one on the same scale (National Gallery, London) and the other a smaller replica, intended as a gift for his mother and sister (private collection).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPUYWhJte7uCra9t7e3N3uPcf5oTPKvcX1yqp5gUH3nRv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZuc71gwi4uKuhRVDYQnMAPDyKd41myzTfanV1qQkSgnq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPUYWhJte7uCra9t7e3N3uPcf5oTPKvcX1yqp5gUH3nRv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Z9ViyeZPU1WMQ4bXRnW2ed7DbZE63pjyB"], "tags": ["art"], "extra": {}}

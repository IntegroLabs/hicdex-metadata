And this is the end of autumn and the beginning of winter soon. Everything in the forest has finally quieted down and is sinking into sleep. I want you to feel through this photo the damp, cool air, so saturated and even intoxicating that your head is spinning. And enjoy the view of such a wonderful carpet, which the trees created by throwing off their robes.\n| 3472x4624 px |\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSRPkCT7yhMxiLzLLJyAB6MRZHPthBqM63rN7fRECoYtd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYxuD9w385UbSKW88fvtPpydh5MMsa8BT4yRawwLrGJ12", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSRPkCT7yhMxiLzLLJyAB6MRZHPthBqM63rN7fRECoYtd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NB3Pr5WYq74BkMzKGY2EZb32SqhGCG6ue"], "tags": ["fairytaile", "forest", "photography", "color", "wood", "autumn", "wonderland", "photo", "outdoor", "nature", "mood", "harmony", "art", "plant", "life"], "extra": {}}

This is the 14th letter in The Cool Alphabet, C Is For Cell, a tribute to my favorite Dragonball Z villain of all time. I loved most of the androids, especially 17 and 18, and then Cell came along and he was just unstoppable. That was always the MO of DBZ though, every new adversary would be stronger than the last forcing Goku and friends to struggle, level up, and then persevere. I have always had a thing for insects as well and Cells character design certainly leans in that direction with the color palette and his wings. Ultimately Cell was defeated never to be seen again unlike many other DBZ villains, but he will live on as part of The Cool Alphabet.

In the drawing, the artist modified the image building an industrial setting as a contrast to the present day. In 1507, Atalante Baglioni commissioned Raphael this work as a memento of his son Grifonetto, who had died murdered in 1500 during the struggles between members of the same family, for the Lordship of Perugia. The work was to be placed in the family chapel of the church of San Francesco al Prato, Perugia, and remained there until, in 1608, it was sent in secret to Pope Paul V, who gave it as a gift to his nephew, Cardinal Scipione Borghese .By @glauberbnunes","tags":["drawing","study","aftermath","rafael","1507","rafaelsanzio","GalleriaBorghese","pencil"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmWvHz5Wy8bnWPC2LHoP5Svr6HMfuw87faQGt1uh5iiDSk","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWvHz5Wy8bnWPC2LHoP5Svr6HMfuw87faQGt1uh5iiDSk","display_uri":"ipfs://QmX3T4382BHrM7ygb37rxeK3KnuvgcimoRUm7erzNitmwX","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

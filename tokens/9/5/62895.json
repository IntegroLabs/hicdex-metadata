God forbid our torturers","description":"Brazil never lost its place as a colony. Today, it behaves like a flea of capital and ideology. The country tries to instill ideas of economic liberalism, worshiping the capitalist American model.

At the bottom, there is the slavery logic of the place: domination and the makeup of horror. Overlapping images and illustrations from current Brazil and the 16th century.","tags":["politics","brasil","brazil","kkk","racism","hatred","violence","bolsonaro"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmcoS9VDW37NKXxqm7J8EQ5sqZSsC43joybnLrkZCmzpZ9"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcoS9VDW37NKXxqm7J8EQ5sqZSsC43joybnLrkZCmzpZ9","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdJ95dHcLrLEbx3xf47b5jvJjQXV2UF8zeJCCkuPqask3","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

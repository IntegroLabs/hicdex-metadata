On the right, you may see an individual wrought with grief, others may see a determined to communicate with a loved one who has passed away. On the Left, you may see a faceless shadow figure in the foreground, almost taking over the faceless figure behind. When we connect, we exchange auric vibrations. The colors are a representation of the communication with those who have crossed over. At times it may feel that our words we speak into the air are cast into the void. They are not. We are all still in this together, even after those we love are \"gone\"  **  The music is one of many that will be added to my LostMixSessions/ Cooked HardDrive collection.   The songs intent is to push and pull you. The binaural panning of elements of the song is used to sway the listener into a more relaxed mind state… The rhythm renews your thoughts with every tap. Reminding you to stay present and flow.","tags":["music","motiongraphic","spiritual","life","death"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmZqmki6MmdTMrEg4dQzMS331HxJu1SEi7hKy37eHeEc9P","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZqmki6MmdTMrEg4dQzMS331HxJu1SEi7hKy37eHeEc9P","display_uri":"ipfs://QmaAjvXv7nzodkY2BT8JovZmCrE4yPRCUG9GWyjXn4JAx9","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

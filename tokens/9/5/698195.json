We immediately addressed to all the means: brave volunteers took veapons and stood up into the territorial defense, hackers began cyber attacks on Russian websites, businesses stopped collaboration with Russian companies, artists started producing powerful imagery, and people of spirit began their peace meditations and connections to spirit. \n\nWe are Ukrainian, but we are also very open-minded. On my altar there are both Christian saints, buddist and hindo gods, Ukrainian pagan characters. We also use our imagination to address spirits that are created by our exhaulted psyche, like this Ukrainian spirit Vlad Dorosh aka Kolena Golova (Knee Head) created during before-war times. \n\nColoured like Ukrainian Flag, this spirit is aimed to protect peaceful creatures on our territory. You can connect to this spirit by purchasing this token to your collection. We will spend money earned to support Ukrainian volunteers and purchase armour for those, who fight so that we can live, love and create in a free world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcqAMNmkUpDV5njAq3kpBcXnNYegUR8aj2TGyt7jkBzvE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbDLqazWhwiSxfytq8PdyXLWrbSnbQtvRiB6YqL2xcHq3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcqAMNmkUpDV5njAq3kpBcXnNYegUR8aj2TGyt7jkBzvE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dGs54QcmSh7mJ3E8VuCYSgCw8zo3wpv8m"], "tags": ["Peace", "Ukraine", "Spirit", "antiwar", "Ukrainian", "Kyiv", "Poltava", "Protection", "Spiritual", "Imagination", "Pagan", "Creature", "Character"], "extra": {}}

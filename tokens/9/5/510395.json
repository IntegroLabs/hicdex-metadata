Trainwreck is probably a great word to use to describe not this word, but what has happened to the Indigenous peoples of North America. Ohhhh and yeah...this is just the words American/Canadian/Indian all fused into one word where there is overlap. Confused? Let's break it down. AMERICAN and CANADIAN have an over lap and the end and beginning, respectively. We can combine them to form AMERICANADIAN. We then can take this word and then combine it with INDIAN as the ends of both words ends with DIAN. The result is AMERICANADINDIAN: Pronounced AMERI-CANA-DINDIAN. First Nations peoples of North America, known as Turtle Island (The name of what was perceived to be the whole Earth by Indigenous groups in North America, based on a common creation story.) to them lived for thousands of years having their own names and cultures, only to be labeled INDIAN by others. AMERICANADINDIAN explores the concept that process and how it continually applies colonial tension, pressure, control, etc. over First Nations peoples of Turtle Island still to this day. It's time to give them all sovereignty over themselves; it's long overdue. I'm not a \"white savior\", I'm a human being with my eyes wide open. Open yours and you will see the truth.

It’s an ethos for the unstable world we all live in now. As an ethos for life, it means understanding what’s really important & not giving it up. It means taking brave, smart risks and looking at the long term return. It also means hodling your nerve when people think you’re nuts. A series of 4 flavors, this one is a stawberry cake with peach flavored frosting and stawberry syrup.","tags":["cake","food","cute","kawaii","3D","pink","strawberry","peach"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmdEgykgtZpvnBrSS7jbuqt5RacpgSr1HcZTTztSKovPce"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdEgykgtZpvnBrSS7jbuqt5RacpgSr1HcZTTztSKovPce","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

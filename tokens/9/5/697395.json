{"__version": 1, "token_id": 697395, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Folk Tales \u2014 #4 Kintaro and The Giant Carp", "description": "This is the story of Kintaro (often translated as the Golden Boy), one of the Japanese folk heroes in the form of a child with superhuman strength. As a toddler, Kintaro was plump and active. One of the most famous of Kintaro\u2019s exploits is his wrestling with a giant carp, and this is basically my version of the epic wrestling scene that you\u2019re staring at.\n\nI added some rabbit spirits that represent his only friends on the mountain and some flying lampions as a part of my personal celebration. I felt dull and uninspired in the past 2 weeks and it was frustrating in many ways. But then I learnt the hard way how to accept the fact that I\u2019m not Kintaro. I\u2019m not a superhuman, just an ordinary girl who loves to draw instead. Embracing the dull moment and not fighting back, that\u2019s what I did and it worked! I slowly regain my creativity and this is my comeback piece. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdBcoVmghvwSZp5RNDMSGcb9EgXMkjt8vfQjfkhDLgMD4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVRNKTqDEpbL5R1nVQjgqx2ztBHEd3hHQYkLpatmczyCh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdBcoVmghvwSZp5RNDMSGcb9EgXMkjt8vfQjfkhDLgMD4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PdGThHGV3Dj96b7nkeJ6KxPf8x9sZjyP9"], "tags": ["digitalillustration", "digitalart", "colorful", "japanese", "japan", "folktales", "folklore", "ichacho"], "extra": {}}

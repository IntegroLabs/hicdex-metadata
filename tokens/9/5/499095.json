So in recent times I found myself wandering around the streets taking a lot of pictures of faces and human beings and this is something very different from what I've done in the past. Living caged in my neighbourhood without the possibility to travel this style became more and more predominant. However I was always thinking about how to link my cyberpunk influences with my most recent street shots where people where the main subjects. So given my interest for dreamscapes and weird atmospheres along with glitches and sci-fi I came up with this collection: glitch faces.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUjq1PAVAvjbcwwv4tmtJ6j2CKs4Xf83w12mC2kXCn8vS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUwfvtJAA5JiA4UEuj4ovZc1cY3MaBS2EiEDSnft46YJk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUjq1PAVAvjbcwwv4tmtJ6j2CKs4Xf83w12mC2kXCn8vS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hgBSKWzBqzfL2d7zng1vVhLa3JNgGn2Mb"], "tags": ["streetphoto", "streetphotography", "street", "photo", "streetphoto", "streetphotography", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "glitch", "glitchart", "glitchart", "creepy", "spooky", "photographer", "jpg", "art", "jpeg", "streetchunks", "collectibles", "creepy", "halloween"], "extra": {}}

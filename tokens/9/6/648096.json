There\u2019ll be 12 artworks in total from 6 different continents.\n\nBet you guys know already about the popular story of \u201cPuss in Boots\u201d, but do you know that it is originally written as a fable by Giovanni Straparola from Italy? Don\u2019t worry, I just discovered about it too, hehehe. It\u2019s a story about a cat owned by a poor boy. The cat made a promise to provide the boy with fortune and foods. All the cat asked was just a pair of boots and there the cat went on an adventure.\n\nThere was a scene when the cat tricked the King Ogre who owned a castle. The Ogre was not an ordinary ogre as he can turn into any animals he wanted. The cat entered the castle and asked the ogre himself if the rumor was true. The ogre immediately changed himself into a lion to prove it. The cat once again asked the ogre if he could turn into a small animal because everyone doubted his magical power. The ogre offended and turned himself into a mouse, which later eaten by the cat. Very witty and clever, right? Now the castle owned by the cat.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZmGmHbkQs2GVu2b1jg2wYrjNH4cAcr6eqYJvqz6Q7yXN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSv7DTfsy4t7fTnsyKWNAQg34tPSxSdqt3SPrE1jjuMts", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZmGmHbkQs2GVu2b1jg2wYrjNH4cAcr6eqYJvqz6Q7yXN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PdGThHGV3Dj96b7nkeJ6KxPf8x9sZjyP9"], "tags": ["folktales", "pussinboots", "cat", "blackcat", "illustration", "2D", "colorful", "ichacho", "ogre"], "extra": {}}

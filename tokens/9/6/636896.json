{"__version": 1, "token_id": 636896, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Spearit Bear - \"Recharge (Instrumental)\" Music NFT", "description": "This NFT comes with a downloadable file of Spearit Bear's song \"Recharge (Instrumental)\" and a piece of GAN art (AI assisted) that also acts as the album cover. Purchase of this NFT transfers ownership of the digital file and image, not the right to ownership of the music itself. Commercial use of the image or the music file, aside from the resale of this NFT, must be requested and approved by Spearit Bear beforehand.\n\nThis song was created when Spearit Bear finally moved to Puerto Rico and the first thing they heard in the morning were all the different birds singing their welcoming songs. This song is meant to help relieve tension and anger in the mind and calm down from a long day. The Lyrical Version will be released at a later date and purchasers of this NFT will receive one airdropped to their wallet free! (limit one free NFT per wallet, per person.)\n\nThis music NFT qualifies as one that can be collected to add to the 3 needed to be considered a \u2018Booster\u2019 to receive referral bonuses from primary sales, and the 5 total needed for a collector to be considered a 'Builder' and receive monthly Builder pool rewards from secondary sale royalties.

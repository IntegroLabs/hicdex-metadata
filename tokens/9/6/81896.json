Each of these worlds is created by \"hand\" and titled with respect to a randomly generated mixture of the attributes that describe the drivers of the four future archetypes. The total possible permutations of future worlds according to this mashup method is 16000+. Squared #1 is the first 16. The individual pieces are available exclusively on H=N, and are rendered at 2000x2000.","tags":["animation","manyworlds","permutations","possibilities","squaredseries"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmdiU569Gbjkt9Co4EFui4G2X4GPcWckfGYuQdrWHNm7sh"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdiU569Gbjkt9Co4EFui4G2X4GPcWckfGYuQdrWHNm7sh","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

I painted a half-robot human character carrying a book with eyes on chest and knife in hand as a symbol of the balance of knowledge and heart, if science grows without heart and love it will be very dangerous for life. This painting is my hope to see the balance of peace, love and science based on conscience in the future.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSxUJLQjSqodwotMjiHFe7yj1nSeecRx7xHLiSVNgdtmx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPjkCUL6GuP6ySxARvDAD1o12msPvTuYip689rt2HpK23", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSxUJLQjSqodwotMjiHFe7yj1nSeecRx7xHLiSVNgdtmx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YLxReRghzVvk2X99CSQREvStF2RuhcnQX"], "tags": ["painting"], "extra": {}}

{"name": "The Miracle", "description": "Are you searching for a miracle? That amazing miracle that can be anywhere waiting for you, for us. Will it be a spectacular UFO with its lights from another world? Or will it happen on our phone screen, when the miracle suddenly happens and your crush magically likes your post, reposts it, comments it with her, or his, smiling face, that emoji. Or does the miracle come in a form of a cinematic experience, perhaps like in that Italian movie. You sit on a bridge rail, and you sat there because there is that mysterious woman sitting on the same side. Of the bridge, of your side you think. The miracle happens, and she will suddenly look at you, directly to your eyes, with her beautiful eyes saying everything you hoped she will say in this miracle. Miracles are everywhere. We just need to look at all directions. All directions. The miracle can happen where you do not look at. All directions, yes, that is the key for experiencing that gaze, that UFO, that like, that feeling, that miracle.", "tags": ["Miracle", "digital", "Italy", "girl", "woman", "female", "ufo", "love", "filmstill", "photography", "tomivisual", "2021"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmNwVyLDRzVruSKE1neSFLqdTuwbMztTDgR9ULsvnKYWc7", "displayUri": "ipfs://Qmc2gcGmd6R3bEV6ow8dWRjMDsLzkwMsR62uHtL5sdQM7n", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1Si9QC2RuiyPamLRZRjp9YcXXYCuPDm5BC"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNwVyLDRzVruSKE1neSFLqdTuwbMztTDgR9ULsvnKYWc7", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

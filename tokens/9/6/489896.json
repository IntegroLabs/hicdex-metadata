While studying abroad, she struggled with her mental health due to a misdiagnosis and lack of network support. The choice of media shows her transition from painting to collaging after her relapse back in college. Through this series she exhibits an architectural and spatial approach through her food illustrations to communicate a sense of atmosphere, ambiance, mood and emotion of specific symptoms of her mental disorders.\n\nPlease visit www.pinktank.art for more information.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaBhGfF1XPhroo4HyMiCZcH56xio5GLmHgGe9wULtdjqA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaBhGfF1XPhroo4HyMiCZcH56xio5GLmHgGe9wULtdjqA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaBhGfF1XPhroo4HyMiCZcH56xio5GLmHgGe9wULtdjqA", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Me1CjbfEi43zUyas22UatiqC48zxY9wzm"], "tags": ["PinkTank", "MasaMassa", "MalaysianArt", "MalaysiaNFT", "2021", "GIF", "DigitalIllustration"], "extra": {}}

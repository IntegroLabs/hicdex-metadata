They were the eighth pair of brother-and-sister gods to appear after heaven and earth separated out of chaos. By standing on the floating bridge of heaven and stirring the primeval ocean with a heavenly jeweled spear, they created the first landmass.\n\nThe two decided that they wished to unite\u2014often interpreted as marriage\u2014but their first attempt at sexual union resulted in a deformed child, Hiruko (\u201cLeech Child,\u201d known in later Shint\u014d mythology as the god Ebisu), and they set him adrift in a boat. Attributing the mistake to a ritual error on the part of Izanami, who, as a woman, should never have spoken first, they began again and produced numerous islands and deities. In the act of giving birth to the fire god, Kagutsuchi (or Homusubi), Izanami was fatally burned and went to Yomi, the land of darkness. The grief-stricken Izanagi followed her there, but she had eaten the food of that place and could not leave. She became angry when he lit a fire and saw her rotting and covered with maggots. A horrified Izanagi fled, with a host of women and then Izanami herself in pursuit. After reaching the entrance to Yomi, Izanagi placed a stone across it, thus sealing in Izanami and breaking their union.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbn5KoHADbFP6K4ZMwDCNKWkydxc5ZEaMnVnmP4gjmJDy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZBE4jFkwcaE2iBvfGYJchZg7xU7YTFrBRpCDyVJZmzn1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbn5KoHADbFP6K4ZMwDCNKWkydxc5ZEaMnVnmP4gjmJDy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dWC1aKp8vfiFBAC7tZSigyTiumVrWFcwM"], "tags": ["japanese", "mythology", "japan", "anime", "gods", "adam", "digitalart", "generativeart", "abstractart", "minimalart", "minimal", "psychedelic"], "extra": {}}

In this sense, this work presents a critical perspective on the History of Art as an epistemology that has tried to defend USA or Europeâ€™s superiority over the years. This introductory  and panoramic survey argues for the need to question the power structure inherent in art discourses and to decolonize art studies. This GIF was made using objects from ancient cultures from Latin America located nowadays in three distinct USA museums: * Walters Art Museum * Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) * Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). This is just a symbolic rescue about the theme of spoliation/loot of works of art and Latin American cultural property.

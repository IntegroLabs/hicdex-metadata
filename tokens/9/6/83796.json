Work, politics, social media… there is no getting away from it. Most people have a filter or a volume switch that allows them some control over what gets in. Many with mental health issues don’t have access to that volume dial, and in some cases the filter is clogged. I’ve suffered with mental health issues all my life and I have built up techniques to avoid identifying with that cacophonous human noise born of tribal identity. This gif animation expresses how it feels when the noise becomes deafening, charge of the world seeps into the mind. This NFT is in recognition of Mental Health Awareness Week 2021, 10-16 May.","tags":["metaphysical","art","dark","psychedelic","digitalart","gif"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmSdHNaTAm2BjKAuRSmUkn8Gedpt2Ldoj9YcxkEFpH3n8e"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSdHNaTAm2BjKAuRSmUkn8Gedpt2Ldoj9YcxkEFpH3n8e","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdeNv3rzXLmDPFUyYEyJ7NzJnUHa2x3iN56LmHvBjZNvt","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

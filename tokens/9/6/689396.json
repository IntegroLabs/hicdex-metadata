Here, I invite you to engage in \u2018digital moral cleansing\u2019, an opportunity for you to \"wash away\" your immoral acts by purchasing an NFT that would \"clean\" your moral debt. For each of these dark sides, the profits of the NFT will go to a respective charity or research organization. \n\nMoney is the third out of the three pieces. With no government-backed regulatory body protecting or overseeing digital transactions worldwide, money launderers can easily exploit NFTs to wash the money they\u2019ve obtained through illegal activities.

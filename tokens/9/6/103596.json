It tells us not to waste time. Time is what we all wish we could get back during this past year of the COVID-19 pandemic. It made us all realize the fragility of life itself. The pandemic forced us all to realize our own mortality, and appreciate the value of time spent by yourself and with others, because in an instant the world was changed. I created this piece in response to the tumultuous emotions I've felt over the past year or so. So many lives have been lost, but I'm just thankful to be alive. Don't wait for death to bring someone flowers.

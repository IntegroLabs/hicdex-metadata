  "description": "Working in healthcare, I see a lot of death. But this past year has been something else entirely. I have really struggled with the fact that many people do not have the basic humanity of doing what it takes to spare others from suffering. We all live in a society. A society won’t thrive when its members aggressively deny they have any responsibility for other people’s well-being. Public health is not about an individual but the whole of society. All of us, not just you. @dehiscenceart, 2021.",

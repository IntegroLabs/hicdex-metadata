{"name": "ManyWorlds - Squared #3", "description": "The Many Worlds Project is loosely based on the Manoa School approach to Alternative Futures generation (and analysis). Each of these worlds is created by \"hand\" and titled with respect to a randomly generated mixture of the attributes that describe the drivers of the four future archetypes. The total possible permutations of future worlds according to this mashup method is 16000+. Squared #3 is the third set of 16. The individual pieces are available exclusively on H=N, and are rendered at 2000x2000.", "tags": ["animation", "manyworlds", "permutations", "possibilities", "squaredseries"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmQpeSygwVgzGjige5uJRwZSwZnrrzZ48425R7hD95NPfd", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmeJXDqXdWqQkts9LYFy4qaNiqwpGYybAuDxLJvk3Sao7h", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz2UuZCUqSRXcQ9q9eFdSBU5htPaiNzyLexo"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQpeSygwVgzGjige5uJRwZSwZnrrzZ48425R7hD95NPfd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

{"name": "Exploding Mosaics IV: Dogecoin to $1 (3/4)", "description": "Such boom. Much cool. Watch this Dogecoin Mosaic explode and turn into a $1 coin (a reassembled \"$1\" mosaic merging with the faded Dogecoin in the background). There are 2 Limited Editions of this coin (with glistening effects): one minted on OpenSea and one on HEN. There are 4 Regular Editions minted: 2 on OpenSea and 2 on HEN. This piece is the Regular Edition. The first two of the Regular Editions are minted on OpenSea.", "tags": ["dogecoin", "doge", "mosaic"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmcXFjgP76tE6yW4J1K2XNKgZqA2cHR6RfKptj352PTWe9", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmcXFjgP76tE6yW4J1K2XNKgZqA2cHR6RfKptj352PTWe9", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1ZSn8mpeNAdPLfDYqzCYwU1QAGEEGEksit"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcXFjgP76tE6yW4J1K2XNKgZqA2cHR6RfKptj352PTWe9", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

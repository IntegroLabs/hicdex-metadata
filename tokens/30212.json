The piece invites to reflect that life is not in the atoms that compose bodies; rather, life is the organization of these atoms - and each atom can be individually replaced without destroying life. Therefore, life is simultaneously long-lasting and ephemeral. It is up to each of us to see and hear life in its constant change and permanence. We must always contemplate the whirlwind of life.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcMJ9yotTU71NNDe1GYsu9dGsMMTE5HfzLQaJFproThew","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmcMJ9yotTU71NNDe1GYsu9dGsMMTE5HfzLQaJFproThew"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmXqrnKF2hnxvxLXuKYAngTDtURJxfEFSTu7S1uCwG5wsX"},"supply":"5","transfered":10}

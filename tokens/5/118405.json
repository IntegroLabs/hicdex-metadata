{"name": "Skim", "description": "This Interactive NFT changes depending if it\u2019s viewed Day or Night. It\u2019s the first mint that uses the DAY NIGHT open source code. Night artwork is activated between 19:00 and 6:00. The art and audio of this virtual sculpture by Voltaine is a response to the busy world of NFT, offering an ambient sanctuary.   The DAY NIGHT code has been open sourced so anyone using hicetnunc can also make DAY NIGHT artwork. The easy to use code can be downloaded in video and image editions. By collecting this artwork you are supporting further releases. https://github.com/voltaine1/daynight", "tags": ["InteractiveNFT", "DAYNIGHT", "sculpture", "audio", "ambient"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmXTgF3JDFseXKCwCmwwnh6ifmyjaPNfAxxrc7uukApGg7", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmSt17dJtaZjva6Vw8B6ymebZCbfGnjFQjfuA2HZWrE52j", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmX5ay5kZbiDmYdnwy7PA9LcZMmNAgyeqshmuFz9BRumjX", "creators": ["tz1X7MkF4YgW487SwdWhhEtyVSLhDmZTer11"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXTgF3JDFseXKCwCmwwnh6ifmyjaPNfAxxrc7uukApGg7", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

As individuals we all experience depressions in life and the knife piercing through signifies the feeling of a tortured mind. The bloody tears signifies the intensity of the emotion that the depress individual is feeling. And the Blue color symbolizes both sadness and serenity. With this Art that I made I hope that each one of us would have the genuine feeling of concern to each and everyone that we encounter.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXQFZbu75KfYdqbkrAAV53xL3RpNgKjjpmfXqHXpQD7Rb","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1WRHadwY4itY5VzLXyqWA1bvvzpRUHZeBu"],"tags":["Digital","MentalHealthAwareness","Abstract",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmXQFZbu75KfYdqbkrAAV53xL3RpNgKjjpmfXqHXpQD7Rb"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://Qmepe2C9XbnmVvMgxRBfqU3pBCu3NwSMJ9uk2drr9Ciod9"},"supply":"1","transfered":1}

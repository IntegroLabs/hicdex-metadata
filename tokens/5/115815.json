If they dream, they will have things to strive towards. They should only work for the machine. No dreams.  Don't let them see the sunset, they might see the world is a beautiful place. If they see the place they live in is a beautiful place, they will stop working for the machine. Work hours should last after the sunsets.   They should keep their heads down. Buried into their desks, paperworks, screens. Don't let them look up. If they look up, they will see the stars. Stars will make them realize how insignificant they are. Then they will start searching for meaning within.  Give them work, give them worries, stress, so the machine can keep running. No dreams, no sunsets, no stars.

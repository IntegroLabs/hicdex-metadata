For the most part this place was nothing special, but this room captivated me - the partially painted window-frame, the peeling paint showing a beautiful purple beneath, the colorful fan in seemingly perfect condition without a speck of dust - to this day it's my number one favorite photo. Part of a series of 10 of my favorite drawings and photographs, now available as NFTs to hopefully help me recover from losing most of my crypto holdings.","tags":["photography","abandoned","amateur"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmUY1wXnMv5iPpkZ7bwMznrs5GeAXwd28DgujfFZmRahLd"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUY1wXnMv5iPpkZ7bwMznrs5GeAXwd28DgujfFZmRahLd","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

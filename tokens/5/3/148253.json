As a phtographer i find always intriguing the shapes of shadows when sun is on setting mode. The angle of the sun gives shadows a really long shape when you see them on ground. As a photographer intrigued by shadows and their shapes, i couldnt be more intrigued than my own shadow. When i have the chance i make my shadow selfportraits. This is one of them.

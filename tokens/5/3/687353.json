Frankly, I don\u2019t think that figure is good enough to represent such an amazing album. I thought it was okay at first, but the more I look at it, the more I dislike that thing. It was kind of a bummer. \n\nSo, in order for justice to be restored, I decided to mint this Deluxe Version of that particular failed attempt. It\u2019s a limited edition two-figures pack of RTJ\u2019s \u201cRTJ4\u201d. Personally, I'm really satisfied with the result. It make me sleeps better at night after I pretty much butchered the original one. My sincerest apology to Run The Jewels for that sad hack job.\n\nOn a side note: RTJ DID released a \"Deluxe Version\" of \u201cRTJ4\u201d on September 2021. It\u2019s a sprawling 24-tracks effort that features the original 11 \u201cRTJ4\u201d tracks, instrumentals, their Cyberpunk 2077 song \u201cNo Save Point\" and remixes to some fan-favorite album cuts. While \"JU$T\" just receives an eclectic production overhaul from What So Not, \u201cOoh La La\u201d and \u201cThe Ground Below\" both now appear with features from Lil\u2019 Wayne and Royal Blood, respectively. \n  \nEl-P figure is made from Hasbro\u2019s GI Joe Classified \u201cpimp daddy\u201d Destro figure, Mattel\u2019s WWE Mr. T and repainted Legends Elite Ted DiBiase figure, repainted DC Designer Series Lee Bermejo\u2019s Lex Luthor figure, and Super 7\u2019s Run The Jewels figure.\n\nKiller Mike is made from Hasbro\u2019s GI Joe Classified \u201cpimp daddy\u201d Destro figure, Mattel\u2019s WWE Mr. T figure, repainted Marvel Legends Series retro Kingpin and Joe Fixit figure, and Super 7\u2019s Run The Jewels figure.

The year is 2005, I am going to school at The Portfolio Center in Atlanta and volunteered for the AIGA Bi-Annual conference in Boston and traveled there for the duration of the event with a handful of my classmates and instructors. It was an incredibly eventful trip: A - Everyone I went with including myself got Scabies... gross! 2 - I met one of my design heroes David Carson only to find out he was a womanizing has-been. And D - I met and fell hard for a girl from Houston. She was also a volunteer and we first met during work orientation. We got assigned some of the same posts early on and we started talking. There was an instant connection. We ended up spending ALOT of time together over the next 3 days. When it was time to go home I wasn't sure how but I knew I wanted to see her again. We hung out that last night. I gave her my favorite hoody telling her I would get it back from her the next time I saw her. She wrote me this letter, gave it to me, and got in the elevator. I found it again TODAY and had completely forgot it existed...how crazy is that? You can have these wild feelings for someone, and with enough time, you can forget those feelings all together. I went home the next day to my girlfriend. I never got my hoody back.

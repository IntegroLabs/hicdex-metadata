The ouroboros entered Western tradition via ancient Egyptian iconography and the Greek magical tradition. It was adopted as a symbol in Gnosticism and Hermeticism and most notably in alchemy. The term derives from Ancient Greek \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, from \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03ac oura 'tail' plus -\u03b2\u03bf\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 -boros '-eating'. The ouroboros is often interpreted as a symbol for eternal cyclic renewal or a cycle of life, death, and rebirth. The skin-sloughing process of snakes symbolizes the transmigration of souls, the snake biting its own tail is a fertility symbol in some religions, and the tail of the snake is a phallic symbol, the mouth is a yonic or womb-like symbol.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcmjUhc8Fu4C7rEZWDatQAu7Ci2zoMXYgJQEZCcMsfd1n", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcmjUhc8Fu4C7rEZWDatQAu7Ci2zoMXYgJQEZCcMsfd1n", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcmjUhc8Fu4C7rEZWDatQAu7Ci2zoMXYgJQEZCcMsfd1n", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1PddiwC91QhFEwdnEGAJsPtjL6ZKVqrAuT"], "tags": ["gif", "animation", "glitch", "draw", "paint", "handmade", "expressionism", "ilustration"], "extra": {}}

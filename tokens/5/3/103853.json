It is nothing more but a product What goals you follow as an artist? You just want to get some cash into your pockets? Or do you simply want to express yourself? Let your emotions out? Art loses its identity as soon as you put price on it, because your motivation has changed And then there is another problem of art stealing, which is self-explanatory And meeting these two together born something new I have been preserving these thoughts inside me for way too long to stay silent anymore, seeing as the new art market rises  This meme is not mine, the origin of it is not mine, the idea of it is not mine All I did was: Opened browser, which is not mine Opened Google Images, which is not mine Printed \"Sheck Wes Meme\" and downloaded some image, which is not mine Opened this image in Paint app, which is not mine Cropped it, so that the old text cannot be seen and cleared the watermark Chose Comic Sans MS font, which is not mine Added two words to this image and saved it in JPG format  All I need is to express myself All I need is you, people, to hear me out  Everything else is under your decision now EVERYTHING","tags":["gofuckyourself"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://Qmd6gtaKcvRDqNuXhFZrsACztxabaUSpsjmDc5dgRvU1oT"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmd6gtaKcvRDqNuXhFZrsACztxabaUSpsjmDc5dgRvU1oT","display_uri":"ipfs://QmUrACLPH5bYkpS3GpqTvfgXuogjYUvuSvARYXGXXMRtaF","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

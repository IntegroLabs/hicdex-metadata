Everyone is just going back to normal just like that? When in fact, I feel grief. Defeat. Shock. I feel as if I was dragged into collective delusion. Yes, we must move forward, but have we truly mourned? The deaths. The suffering. The upheaval of wanting change. Yet here we all are, going back to our work places, our 9-5s, going back to school, getting engaged, shopping, drinking, partying. When the truth is, it no longer feels real. How can everyone just rush back to normality when the world just crumbled and revealed how messed up everything really is. We try our best to go back to normal again, but we cannot lie to ourselves how different the world has become. I feel stuck, knowing that going back to normal could mean going back to the lies of the previous world. How can we say we survived the attack of Death and Pestilence, and then go back to the way things were. In fact, these Horsemen haven't even left. We have to move on, but there's an overwhelming eerieness. My soul feels so distant from this normal we speak of.

The subjects are replaced with people of color and the inanimate objects are replaced with classic cameras. This piece was the most difficult one for me to create. I hope you like it. The model is one of my best friends.","tags":["photography","magritte","reimagined","NotToBeReproduced","reproduced","mirror","afro","","surrealist","photo","fraternity","diversity"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmYfMkyNR4HEXqn6ymtDVLn7UthomXPSWQERf56T7cNbRD"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYfMkyNR4HEXqn6ymtDVLn7UthomXPSWQERf56T7cNbRD","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Oh wait, I said that before...oops. But for real, this time it is. In LAVENDER SOAP, we're not saying I love you. We started off with the cryptically aspirational message of LIFE AND THERE'S HOPE and just like before on other works, we reduced and condensed the sentence to it's alter ego form: LAVENDER SOAP. Even though this doesn't contain a romantic or deep meaning per se, it does once again illustrate the power of the homophonic phenomenon within the English language. I can only imagine how bewildered and frustrated English must sound and/or appear to be to a non-native English speaker. What seems like banal or easy wordplay to those that speak and use the language everyday, are actually challenging moments that sometimes push comprehension to the brink. Does this make English more unique because of its inherent complexities? I would argue yes. LAVENDER SOAP shows us that even in the most ridiculous abstract statement there is an inner beauty to be admired; the structure; the rules.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW3vyDsfzCd9oXqKeEZueeujFXWwQRCTUxtck9S1iVHCk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZpDD85jyGqQevMQjL1a8jf2UJqQhod1PZRWaTkGYqaDr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW3vyDsfzCd9oXqKeEZueeujFXWwQRCTUxtck9S1iVHCk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

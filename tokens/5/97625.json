The path you must follow is endless and you will die before you really wake up. All you really have is Time. I may be happier now than ever before, and yet I cannot help but admit that I would give anything to be myself - an infinitely unhappy, nervous, wild, lost and desperate Soul. Angry, yearning, awkward - but alive. If you know how to feel, then this awareness is much more important than what you feel.  The death of the soul is the only thing that time does not forgive.

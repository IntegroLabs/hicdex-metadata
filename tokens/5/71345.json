Planet of the Celestials.  I found a place Iâ€™ve heard vague stories about.  A place hitherto unseen, the inhabitants of which were the Celestials, the ancient gods.  They say they are our fathers.  We have worshiped them for centuries.  Now they are in front of me, forgotten and gone to the eternal sleep. I am plagued by questions, to which no one has answers: Is it possible to wake them up?  Should I do this?  And where will it lead if I succeed?","artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmcr5843zDSA9i6KGcFWT625xaKqtLVNZCJUWaR9U6ebfx","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1ehcgn7wUn3WeFkUJjVP1for5oSrNLUMmo"],"tags":["space","spacejourney","planet","fantasy","farrukmurad","environment","charactervividcolors","blue","purple","fantasyworld","world","gods","astronaut","journey","story","dark"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://Qmcr5843zDSA9i6KGcFWT625xaKqtLVNZCJUWaR9U6ebfx"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmRp6bQSsmZHsCPrQ7DjHZsMQ63qha2MMbqGuXYNNdpEzR"},"supply":"50","transfered":50}

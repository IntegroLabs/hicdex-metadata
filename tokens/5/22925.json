Each of these fibers is approximately 3.5 nanometers in width, which is about 25,000 times smaller than a human hair. This is the most powerful type of microscope in the world, and among the highest resolution images ever taken of a biological sample like this.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNfEmssqdR59f2PXFjh7X8yaRnCCdVbsQ2mgSXtvaACzW","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmNfEmssqdR59f2PXFjh7X8yaRnCCdVbsQ2mgSXtvaACzW"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmWzSHEERctCkBabjoW4MnfK5MozShzTs61EPMSh5nN49R"},"supply":"5","transfered":5}

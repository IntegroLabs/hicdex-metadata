How you taught me to calm down, to sit back, to listen ;\nI like how you offer the littles a shelter, and allow them to watch\nthe world from upstairs.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Generative drawing\n\u2014 Made with Javascript code\n\u2014 Format JPG\n\u2014 Resolution 4455x6300", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmevEhw2AUECw3ayq3n4LK4wi1ctrBNRMM7XdjHs3FCXqM", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb4d2q1rGPMNJEYNBXoAcgh1Wn5rWFqDyAHJigAj1Ao7n", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmevEhw2AUECw3ayq3n4LK4wi1ctrBNRMM7XdjHs3FCXqM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UN87Bz34YVbMwr3y9xSjGzVMyAjUKnDUQ"], "tags": ["generativeart", "monochrome", "tree", "javascript", "lushtemples"], "extra": {}}

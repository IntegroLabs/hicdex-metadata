In the following weeks, he ate and slept in his laboratory. About six weeks after his discovery, he took a picture\u2014a radiograph\u2014using X-rays of his wife Anna Bertha's hand.\nWhen she saw her skeleton she exclaimed \"I have seen my death!\". These studies earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics. In honour of R\u00f6ntgen's accomplishments, in 2004 the UIPAC named element 111 as roentgenium after him. The unit of measurement roentgen was also named after him.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYhVKyKdSuscEioHjnBbFc2wMVQnw1mZxFf7RsGzpGL3b", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZXJ97HekrMGLCowx85Jur28s1owFG5k2DPTEH3zybg7S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYhVKyKdSuscEioHjnBbFc2wMVQnw1mZxFf7RsGzpGL3b", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ULFbYs5KoAdoySxg7A6YUt2jruA5vbxNX"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

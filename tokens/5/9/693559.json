It was created to depict the hummingbirds and butterflies attracted by colorful, nectar-rich flowers of floral gardens. The hummingbirds and butterflies are pollinators which play a major role in the pollination of flowers.  In this role, the hummingbirds and butterflies transport pollen grains from a flower's male part (anthers) to another flower of the same species. Then, the pollen grains are transferred to the second flower's female part (stigma). Hence, pollination of the second flower which yields seeds to produce a new plant. The \"Colorful Floral Gardens NFT Series\" reflects natural gardens of wildflowers and backyard gardens at sunrise as well as sunset; along mountainsides, and on river banks. \n\nThe images were created with the assistance of artificial intelligence, VQGAN+CLIP (machine learning algorithms), and text prompts. The image may be interpreted differently through the eyes and imagination of the viewers.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbSgkDQKAWS1JDj82wGEjwzgrtFeQnAt3crTu6vEPx2vJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbSgkDQKAWS1JDj82wGEjwzgrtFeQnAt3crTu6vEPx2vJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbSgkDQKAWS1JDj82wGEjwzgrtFeQnAt3crTu6vEPx2vJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XQeAkWGur8esmmuChxBN5VTZk4X3Z48gH"], "tags": ["hummingbirds", "butterflies", "pollinators", "pollination", "seeds", "flowers", "floral", "gardens", "spring", "nature", "blossoms", "bloom", "mountainside", "sunrise", "sunset", "river"], "extra": {}}

MP4, 1000x800, 15\". Based on the artwork from Aksenov Family Foundation Collection\n\nThe artist's work has always been inspired by her interactions with other people. One day she archived all her messenger chats, saved the conversations as one file. Then Liza spent a whole week reading them as if they were a book. But this text was a random set of words, pieces of a puzzle that did not fit together because the conversations always seemed to be a torn, underwritten sentence. It wasn't really a dialogue, because everyone was writing about something different. The artist began to take sentences out of conversations and sign her abstract drawings with them as if decoding the image. Both the image and wording don't mean much on their own but together they become something like a road sign. This work is another attempt to grasp the fleeting moments that are beautiful in their randomness and that too quickly turn into memories at the speeds of modern life\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUPosK6WfKKiNrPYANo5NToCrdzckJDzk8E7griFG6Nkv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfPPmyNH2gD6jhH5DZdCRVVnFhmx5aeZWAJQUNHWg5esu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZkHAucxKH6wKpALGK8ecnTWSF3bfFoeUKjV6xCrV6BFH", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUPosK6WfKKiNrPYANo5NToCrdzckJDzk8E7griFG6Nkv", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2V1ck8D4hqaF9cmi7DzDtGfbHo1LhWhUMp"], "tags": ["bobkova", "lizabobkova", "drawing", "wordart", "love", "ink"], "extra": {}}

Intimacy in the broad sense of the word is available in all sizes and colours.\nIn 2019 I visited Tokyo for two longer periods, with my focus on connection, intimacy and social contact. Keeping distance, 'social distancing' as we now know it, is the rule rather than the exception. It is as if Japanese society is permeated with an existential loneliness, which we as Westerners like to deny.

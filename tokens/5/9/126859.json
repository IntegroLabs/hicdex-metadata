I cannot relate. Do not invite me. Do not involve me. I feel joy in missing out. I already know what I like. If I'm feeling it, I will go. If I'm not feeling it and I still go, it feels strange and uncomfortable that I'm just wasting my time. My social battery runs out quickly in certain social environments. I'm not truly an introvert. I am extroverted for the things that make me feel alive. Invite me to something I don't vibe with, my thoughts will dance in search of an excuse: \"I'm not feeling well!\" until I run out of them. Invite me to the things I love and my heart will race out of excitement.

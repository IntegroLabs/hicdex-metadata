Created live on the 30th May, 2021 from 6.05pm - 6.15pm (UTC). Shot live by award-winning photographers around the world in Chile, Kazakhstan, Germany, Canada, USA, and Scotland. Directed and edited live by pioneering live filmmaker Michael Beets and live composed by Domino. Shot on mobile phones; each creative was given the theme 'Pressure' to interpret in their footage. This is part of an ongoing series where each edition will aim to push and experiment live digital experiences with bold ideas. Each sold NFT will go directly into paying the artists and delivering the next edition. Thanks for coming on board from the start. Next Up- Edition Two: Audiences explore a 3D world full of live camera feeds that will climax into a live show with dancers around the world performing to the same live composed track (uncompressed render available, HEN is limited to 40mb)","tags":["film","live","experience","photographers","world","shortfilm"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmYCojtjs3WFQi7h9Lc54bccAznori5HDZ3NtczDPXedX1"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYCojtjs3WFQi7h9Lc54bccAznori5HDZ3NtczDPXedX1","display_uri":"ipfs://QmU8McRjyfDhawcZtQT3ct2nZByur1zy4jtHpGKE2yho7B","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

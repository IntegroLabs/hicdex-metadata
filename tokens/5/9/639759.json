Bitmap thus acts not only as a map of a digital image, but a map of a real, physical place.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT1eGbzKkXn53NGrgrmD47RRu2MBvzTRbPzF25E1BBLHD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ4iACBaoDjTqTAnRCg6MUdxAccH7BNcEFYHiszkxr3UE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT1eGbzKkXn53NGrgrmD47RRu2MBvzTRbPzF25E1BBLHD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ccPqkde4jjEgbcn51YmPCtJrxBQorAq3U"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "bitmap", "landscape", "architecture", "environment", "colour", "limitededition"], "extra": {}}

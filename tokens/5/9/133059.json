It doesn't. Its just our beautiful world, keeps on spinning.  Here's a fun fact.   510.1 million kmÂ² for 7 billion people ( and the vast number of other life forms ). But beyond earth, there's the gigantic powerhouse, 151.96 million km away, and vast number of stars Billions and trillions of KMs away, still visible to us, and billions of planets ( possibily some support life ) still reminding us that we are a very tiny part of this vast, ever expanding universe.

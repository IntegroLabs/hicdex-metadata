This is the 18th letter in The Cool Alphabet, V Is For Vader. I love Star Wars but as I attempted to lay out the entire alphabet on paper I found myself using TOO many references to the franchise. At 1 time I had Anakin, Boba, Luke/Leia, Han, Darth, Grogu, Jedi, R2-D2, and as I came up with various other things to use I narrowed them down to ONLY E Is For Ewok and V Is For Vader. I really love the costumes and especially all the amazing helmets in Star Wars and have a small collection of them from various IPs including Ant Man, Star Lord, Kylo Ren, The Mandalorian and an excellent Darth Vader which was used for the main image in todays piece. I personally identify more with the good guys but my wife straight up knows she belongs to the Dark Side which you might think would put us at odds, but opposites definitely attract.

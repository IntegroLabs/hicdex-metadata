Each of these worlds is created by \"hand\" and titled with respect to a randomly generated mixture of the attributes that describe the drivers of the four future archetypes. The total possible permutations of future worlds according to this mashup method is 16000+. Squared #3 is the third set of 16. The individual pieces are available exclusively on H=N, and are rendered at 2000x2000.","tags":["animation","manyworlds","permutations","possibilities","squaredseries"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmQpeSygwVgzGjige5uJRwZSwZnrrzZ48425R7hD95NPfd","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQpeSygwVgzGjige5uJRwZSwZnrrzZ48425R7hD95NPfd","display_uri":"ipfs://QmeJXDqXdWqQkts9LYFy4qaNiqwpGYybAuDxLJvk3Sao7h","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

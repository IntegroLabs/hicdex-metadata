Wraith is an average sized fluffle with common ears, and frill. uncommon bob tail, and variant translucent coat/color. Due to a mutation wraith is rather see through and can be difficult to find at times, especially on foggy days.    Personality wise, wraith tends to be rather independent, which is lovely for the busy fluffle owner who cannot always be around for more needy fluffles. The only downside is you may lose sight of Wraith for extended periods of time. Their last owner thought they had gone missing after not seeing them for over a month. Theyre not sure what Wraith was eating during that time...

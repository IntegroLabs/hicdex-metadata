I've mentioned it before that I do quite a bit of work for Coca-Cola at my day job so of course I loved this billboard from Times Square, and I'm quite sure it's been replaced since I took this photo in the early 2000's. This billboard was amazing. Those silhouettes of the men would periodically walk out onto the screen and it would appear as if they were doing maintenance with sparks flying and flickering on and off. It looked so realistic that I did a double take...and waited for it to cycle back around which took several minutes. I really do genuinely love advertising and typography and actively try and incorporate it into much of my work in this collection.

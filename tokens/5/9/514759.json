'Is it alive?'\n'It can talk,' said Haigha solemnly.\nThe Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said 'Talk, child.'\nAlice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: \n'Do you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too? \nI never saw one alive before!'\n'Well, now that we have seen each other,' said the Unicorn, \n'if you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you. Is that a bargain?'\n'Yes, if you like,' said Alice.\n\n-Lewis Carroll, \"Through the Looking Glass\"\n\nHand cut collage. Sydney, Australia.

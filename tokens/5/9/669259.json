{"__version": 1, "token_id": 669259, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "GRAVITY", "description": "One way or another we all have a deeply personal relationship with gravity. Whether you think about it on a daily basis or never ponder it all, we all feel its effects on our bodies and everything around us. It's one of fundamental forces of the universe; a natural phenomenon that causes all things with mass or energy to attract (or gravitate towards) to one another. Gravity is so amazing that there are certain points in the universe where gravity's pull is so strong that not even light itself can escape. These parts are formed when giant stars go supernova and spectacularly become black holes. So how do we visualize gravity using only words and being as minimal as possible? There's no right way, but I felt the most logical and straight forward choice would be to use the word GRAVITY itself and rapidly shrink the text each subsequent line below the top, culminating to a point made of tiny letters. Not quite a black hole, but an image that defines and illustrates the power of gravity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXWdoD7ixwRtMhnDk3UrZMSh9AWCn9Zj4sCbKcaDN9ce9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdAd4CHEALJdDGxSLthT611vkwpWxx4j1z5ZNXfuPWQzJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXWdoD7ixwRtMhnDk3UrZMSh9AWCn9Zj4sCbKcaDN9ce9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

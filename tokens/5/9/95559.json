Years of oppression in culture around the world made women treated as a piece of furniture. Always asked and told what to do, how to live and not. Now is the time to break out of that darkness and not to listen but to do what you believe and want. The artwork is a visual representation of the same, the wood texture depicts that furniture aspect which is cracking down and bringing in the light of hope.

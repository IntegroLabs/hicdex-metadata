With the smallest possible unit in quantity and value, it is released into the world. It should not be owned, but passed on if possible. In its metadata, after thousands of years, its history can then be read by future archelogist. How the units of quantity and value have changed in the meantime, who has possessed it where, and how it may have been altered. This action can be copied endlessly.

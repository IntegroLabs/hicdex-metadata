The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRWfZ67z3zbSNTXbtSw7dHmQJSH1BYCexCFEArWY1MmUX","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1ft8ZPvFdcsMa2LyyA4h53Mm61bRHXBMfc"],"tags":["algoritm","art","random","generative","gif"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmRWfZ67z3zbSNTXbtSw7dHmQJSH1BYCexCFEArWY1MmUX"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmWjuFAkKQnirAe82nffVTnJdZEA8GKBrHhgy1D9kZ7nVM"},"supply":"1","transfered":1}

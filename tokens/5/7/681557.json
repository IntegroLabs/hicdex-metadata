Is it ironic to take a photograph of a camera? How long until young people have no idea what a Polaroid camera is or what it does? There always seems to be a cyclical resurgence of old fashion and technology, but can that really go on forever? I recently read a book that described the amount of time it would take for language to be lost if everyone on earth died off, and it would take thousands of years for most relics of human knowledge to deteriorate. In the end will NFTs outlast physical work? One depends on electricity and tech to exist, and the other is vulnerable to erosion and time. I know I won't be around to see which wins out but in the end if ANYTHING is still around 5000 years after humans are gone it will be an amazing achievement.

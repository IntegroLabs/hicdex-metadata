When Jack died, God didn\u2019t allow him into heaven, and the Devil didn\u2019t let him into hell, so Jack was sentenced to roam the earth for eternity. In Ireland, people started to carve demonic faces out of turnips to frighten away Jack\u2019s wandering soul.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQEfRfpbaJJuQtkjB2Y6hRvq3DY8aE7s4S8KGWet5EFTd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeW85P5wW36F6jF9uGCghVjt6vFiEFj2MKZEcr4dYHGPr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQEfRfpbaJJuQtkjB2Y6hRvq3DY8aE7s4S8KGWet5EFTd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e2iUmhoRUMfR5jrLsvEmvewRFZfuiNL9h"], "tags": ["Illustration", "character", "art", "painting", "drawing", "nft", "surreal", "cryptoart", "modernart"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 147657, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Satanic Satyr", "description": "The accusation of \u2018evil\u2019 has long been used as a justification for the most unspeakable atrocities, including oppression, genocide, and ecological destruction. Monotheistic religions have sought to undermine and malign the nature-based spiritual traditions and practices of indigenous peoples throughout the world. Herbalists and midwives were burnt at the stake, under the accusations of \u2018witchcraft\u2019 and consorting with the \u2018Devil\u2019. So often, nature itself, its innocent creatures, and its sacred spaces, have been associated with dark magic, demons, and hell. This intentional destruction and denigration of our connection to the natural world has served to trap us as indentured servants to a false form of spirituality, predicated upon sacrificing our natural power, to an oppressive authority disguised as a sacred saviour. This goat-human hybrid being - the Satanic Satyr - is neither demonic, nor evil, but rather, a symbol to reclaim our carnal, primal, primitive, animalistic nature. Instead of looking upon our natural spirit with hatred and violence, we celebrate our dark side, our deep side, our fiery spirit.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVm9BPapLmL54YokSbfHjQAzGfiQpLXuSqontDnvehefg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSatGFPRycubuxP4AcSkDr7i41cQKMs8cteQGu3KgEnww", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVm9BPapLmL54YokSbfHjQAzGfiQpLXuSqontDnvehefg", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gWDVuEL5bi7fRLhXMX3sbBHFc3a4YuibY"], "tags": ["HEN666", "666", "Satan", "Satanism", "Goat", "Satyr", "TotemAnimal", "Animation", "Loop", "MethodicalMonkeys"], "extra": {}}

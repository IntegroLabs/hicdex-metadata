What is more terrifying is the fear of death. The fear of death makes us besides suffering. It also makes us refuse to prepare for death. That refusal will eventually bring great suffering when that day comes. But if we admit that we ourselves will die sooner or later We realize that instead of running away from death for the rest of our lives. It is better if we turn our hearts to prepare for death. For this is the only way for us to find peace when the end comes.","tags":["skull","spirit","gold","life","art","3d"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmNg7dHHPs3dqpht6Y2kwRvoUqqRDWTn4UUAHEh9otKH5o"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNg7dHHPs3dqpht6Y2kwRvoUqqRDWTn4UUAHEh9otKH5o","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

As away from the planet, the crust changes, the temperature plummets, and the planet gradually freezes. \n\n[Story]\nIn another parallel universe, a primordial planet exploded violently at the end of its life, and its substance spread outward, split to form planets of different sizes and shapes, over time and movements.\nFor all planets, you can click to rotate the angle or zoom in and out at will, so that you can feel these mysterious planets more realistically. \u2014 carved by ZBrush, expanded the UV through RizomUV, then drew with high quality substance through Substance Painter, and finally completed the whole piece through Blender.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSjtY1U8uqcB25CdcM6eNSR1znCfZfA3KPuLTwDAuHkVX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcSMdtyRdJYkGHGxURFYD5rMgaQptocU3iYAsYV1b3D1c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSjtY1U8uqcB25CdcM6eNSR1znCfZfA3KPuLTwDAuHkVX", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LqUVHLqSr4w1WErYwuUkGYs5qWujzdjEj"], "tags": ["1"], "extra": {}}

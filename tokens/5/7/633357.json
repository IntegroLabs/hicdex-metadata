In preparation for the release of my debut AI album 'WIRE', my work from collection 'ME MACHINE' are keys to access my private metaverse exclusively for owners of these collectibles.  This video is a tiny glimpse of one of the music videos from the album I created using multiple layers of processes involving a video of myself used as the input data for multiple approaches for the final output.  \n\nMy process involves intricate feedback layers of content combining text to image, audio to image, and video style transfer.  Thanks to Pollinations.AI and the entire open source community.  \n\n10% of proceeds of this art pieces everyone who purchases this art piece will go to Pollinations.AI to support open source culture.  Rest of payments from these art pieces will help pay for time and resources to produce rest of visuals for this project.  Thank you for supporting my journey XO.\n\n1920x1080 mp4\n4 seconds", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbPxME9zKtg87LGirFLdjtuq9Hj6fCe3k8SLRpKgvy5we", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTh9JmfEb4SDkeD334CQiUuw91F9LApYpdWSnX6An4nEL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbPxME9zKtg87LGirFLdjtuq9Hj6fCe3k8SLRpKgvy5we", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["KT1FDKe2PxrcxEq2CpQp21Uf2XrtGbwpW4Sk"], "tags": ["styleGAN", "AI", "audiovisual", "pollinations", "videostyletransfer", "texttoimage"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 400157, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Mobula", "description": "Mobula is a genus of ray in the family Myliobatidae. Their appearance is similar to that of Manta rays, which are in the same family. Species of this genera are often collectively referred to as \"Flying Mobula\" or simply \"Flying rays\", due to their propensity for breaching, sometimes in a spectacular manner. The Devil fish can attain a disc width of up to 5.2 metres and can probably weigh over a ton, second only to the Manta in size. Despite their size, little is known about this genus, much of it being from anecdotal accounts. Mobula rays in the Gulf of California have been reported to breach as high as 2 metres above the sea.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW62CLfXY7BqR8aviHw9gHfQggtnJ1GHgMFD4yZJxwYbc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYKRMbyCHeaDTmMZhwfVGELBqJUV3hPwKj6QmKrAoPM6S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW62CLfXY7BqR8aviHw9gHfQggtnJ1GHgMFD4yZJxwYbc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QanVS6UuVLHoto85pwUnGBFnxjPPLvLrV"], "tags": ["art", "manta", "mobula", "artwork", "cartoons"], "extra": {}}

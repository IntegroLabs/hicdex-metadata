Inside me, ideas bubble up, a great broth of ideas that do not materialize.\nRelax, play, perception, my mind, my muse is released. I move away from the comfort zone. I think... I feel... In the darkest areas I find the light. \nMist arises, ghosts dance with my muse while having fun in the game of shadows. There is no color, only black and white. I order, I disorder. I change, I feel and sense the change.\nJust one more process of so many already lived.\n(Motivational Series.

It feels nice to spend time alone in the woods, even we still travel as a group. Like go to bushes to take a pee, midnight poo when everyone asleep, hanging on a hammock that placed between two trees far away from other tent. And listening to the silence of earth.\n\n\n\n|About Journey to The Unexplored|\n\nExplore can be anything. It can be places, feelings, someone, thoughts, literally anything. This is a collection of my photographs that i captured during the darkest time and post-darkest time of my life. Exploring places is just metaphor for guide us to a deeper meaning.\n\nShots on 35mm using Fujica M1 analog camera taken in Indonesia.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWPDpQY2NAwfojyXttjoAVZ9hMXWTvExn2jbB38gU6Ywh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYpLaxpuJ2CgQEHFTk1N6AcbJrdnLRmfyTXS6fm45UFhY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWPDpQY2NAwfojyXttjoAVZ9hMXWTvExn2jbB38gU6Ywh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hTndxxhNiEgMjXGi3WbvR6iz2NpCFRtcJ"], "tags": ["photography", "analog", "travel", "35mm", "dog", "mountain"], "extra": {}}

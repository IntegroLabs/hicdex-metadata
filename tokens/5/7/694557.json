This is also true for crypto art. The data centers consume a lot of energy and we should always thing twice on what to upload and what not.\nThis illustration combines symbols: Building (data center), sun, rays, solar panels, cloud (blue as text), earth (green as text). The question mark after green asks the question whether extensive use of the data cloud is actually green or not.

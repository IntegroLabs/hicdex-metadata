Yes please, dear space trash of more than a hundred million pieces, shower over me. I wanna watch you de-orbit. Let me know when and where you're crashing. I love the fact that space junks can just end me while lockdowns are still in place. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe on my backyard. Maybe I'll catch the big pieces and hold them close to my heart. Maybe I'll catch the smaller pieces with my mouth like raindrops or snow. Or maybe it won't be me - maybe it will take out my enemies, in the shower or in their sleep. I'm rooting for you, space debris. May you fall over the land of my enemy.","tags":["poetry","essay","literature","storytelling","spilledink","philosophy","capitalism","socialcommentary","whimsical","childrensart"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmfSgPCD8nX81N76ET6DE9mVmhaENpCCgzJM1gFPqqmpXq","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmfSgPCD8nX81N76ET6DE9mVmhaENpCCgzJM1gFPqqmpXq","display_uri":"ipfs://QmSDrDS4ejSxZcwqCrDRmveFRtBNCTZoctgFhSmNQkTZBa","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

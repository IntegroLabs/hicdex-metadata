The character was created by writer Louise Simonson and artist Walt Simonson and first appeared in X-Factor #17 (June 1987). In subsequent years, the character was featured as a member of the original New Mutants team and the original X-Force team, and continued to appear in various X-Men franchise publications thereafter. In comic books published in the 1980s and 1990s, Rictor's mutant powers were to generate and manipulate seismic energy and creating tremendously powerful vibrations in any nearby object, inducing earthquake-like phenomena and causing objects to shatter or crumble. The typeface used is Clarendon Black.","tags":["36DAYSOFTYPE","MARVEL","TYPOGRAPHY","X-MEN","XMEN","CARD","CARDS","ALPHABET","DESIGN","COLLECTION","art","artist","R","Rictor","Hero"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmeBNv5AumBZgKXfGkew5KmsoxnJJfYKZJaLHWyz421Rva"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmeBNv5AumBZgKXfGkew5KmsoxnJJfYKZJaLHWyz421Rva","display_uri":"ipfs://QmV1FXc5i7WAbjzt63HuTJVw1a3Kx3EBeicnmkMpb2JAeN","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

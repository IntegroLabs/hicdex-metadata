A naughty boy with rabbit ears on his head who often acts and sometimes irritates his surroundings. He often spends his free time by daydreaming on the dock and playing games on his portable console to kill boredom. He doesn't like math, he finds history and mythology more interesting than arithmetic. He is easily recognizable by his daily outfit which is a windbreaker with patterned shorts. It is one of Bibi's hallmarks.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWMG34mzMuiUVTGq4gmQVC7ffsPUD2P73fiC5sLhy6dKo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcPzmT4gqcLPk87hRv2K3XoKpYZYTkPHkAsRvAEWM5WDe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWMG34mzMuiUVTGq4gmQVC7ffsPUD2P73fiC5sLhy6dKo", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gdRN1XcDeEpsP8KHDy9nc8c1JPBvCerde"], "tags": ["lucidcity", "characterdesign", "illustration", "dystopia", "fantasy", ""], "extra": {}}

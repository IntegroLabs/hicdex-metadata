Like most of the music I write, this one sits buried in a forgotten industrial estate warehouse on the outskirts of my priorities. When I find time to visit, it becomes the best song in the world, the answer to everything. Then it’s not and it’s shite again, a dusty reminder of everything I ever got wrong. Most producers I know have songs that never see the light of day, the push and pull of them is what makes you work.

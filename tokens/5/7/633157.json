The person portrayed in this work is an introvert filled with ideas and creativity. Even though he\u2019s very shy, he\u2019s a big source of art, inspiration and positivity.\nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfQZyV9w51SDy3eCcXN7Cn795Gvwj3VxUnYZJCp61Bt3X", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSzCfe9dvTj7pbWp5nL8cy6MbCye1bMQWaJpa7JD4oWLn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfQZyV9w51SDy3eCcXN7Cn795Gvwj3VxUnYZJCp61Bt3X", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours", "feelings", "art", "creativity"], "extra": {}}

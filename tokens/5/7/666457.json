This event caused more attention towards the Punkys and more Tezos people came forward to snag them.\nWe named them shooter or hunter for their unique speed in buying the freshly minted Punkys. These hunters were a great reason for Punkys' performance in sale, and they caused others to join the hunt and challenge their hunting skills!\nAs the Punky collection is done, we evaluate the people who bought in primary as natural born hunters!\n\nThis airdrop is designed to appreciate the people who became primary holders by hunting Punkys in objkt!\n\nThis is how we picture you when a Punky is listed!\n\nRarity tool: \nhttps://punky.vercel.app", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRpeTEampGCRB1tfEHWN8dUrFGjQk82teY9eM4C1Djb2p", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaCQjvJSKhesY6TJevyBNFXNpzisUD4sch3LKe18DfBpR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRpeTEampGCRB1tfEHWN8dUrFGjQk82teY9eM4C1Djb2p", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PL66ojBvsXYZAZ7p9JMrYiKrwTfcyiHhw"], "tags": ["punky", "airdrop"], "extra": {}}

I am a dreamer female artist who lives in Brazil. My biggest dream is to live through my art and my creativity, and also to help make the world a fairer place for people and animals. If all goes well, I even intend to create shelters that are cozy and heavenly for abandoned or needy animals.\nI am currently in college, studying Visual Arts. I also love writing and playing the piano. I love animals a lot, including dinosaurs and the mythical ones like dragons.\nMy Twitter account: @danihp_art\nMy Instagram art account: @dani_hp_art", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaaApi93jywiuK3qyi275jtMoCyXXMw7jSu1NCTAU1Ktx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYttwq2zgtzsD6kdAxxHWKYVtw7dVdHVQsaBPEZDVcJNf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaaApi93jywiuK3qyi275jtMoCyXXMw7jSu1NCTAU1Ktx", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MnL9oSz51vjrnFNt3oF3NQ6mfm6UoeSzQ"], "tags": ["kawaii", "cat", "cats", "kitten", "kitty", "kittens", "animal", "animals", "pets", "love", "valentine", "valentine'sday", "lovely", "romance", "romantic", "pink", "purple", "starry", "cute", "couple", "aesthetic", "galaxy", "magic", "dream", "dreamy"], "extra": {}}

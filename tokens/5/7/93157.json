He is currently homeless is Erie, Pa. At first he was NOT interested in letting me take a photo. I started talking to the guy next to him about NFTs and explained what I was doing. After a while, he motioned over and said Why not, lets do it. I told him that if I made any money, Id come back to find him. Pops gets the first 50% of all sales, the rest will be donated to the Erie Mission. The only money that I will keep will be the 10% royalties on secondary sales.","tags":["somethingstrange","erie","homeless","mission","pops"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmbqUqoKtyeHcRXj4j63F7ZrKURCMZP8JCFFa75GHCixNh"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbqUqoKtyeHcRXj4j63F7ZrKURCMZP8JCFFa75GHCixNh","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

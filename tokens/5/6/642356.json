Over time I have created many pieces of art in different media that feature birds, often depicting mythological or legend archetypes or creatures. This piece juxtaposes the lightness and softness of bird/feather with the hardness and heaviness of a rock, also symbolizing the enduring nature of our collective and historical fascination with these creatures, as they are featured in myths, stories, legends and folklore throughout history and the world. For me, they are a symbol of playfulness and freedom but also a connection to the more mystical and esoteric dimensions of existence.

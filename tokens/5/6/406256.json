He restores all of creation. He heals the broken hearted, binds their wounds, brings comfort to the weak. He compels each and everything to his divine will but is never Himself compelled.\n\nHe is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior. Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him. (Holy Quran 59:23)\n\nAnd you do not will except that Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise. (Holy Quran 76:30)\n\n \u201cWho created me, and He [it is who] guides me. And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink. And when I am ill, it is He who cures me. And who will cause me to die and then bring me to life And who I aspire that He will forgive me my sin on the Day of Recompense.\u201d (Quran 26:78-82)\n\nWho created me, and He [it is who] guides me.Allah is omnipotent, he does answer to anyone. \u201cHe is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.\u201d (Quran 21:23)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT29ZEdZ1RArPSd8iwCRmyYofbyVCWGg4RWMQAzpkBLh9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdMPyUaDhr9VByHy2NzteoWjHhknevLGTPgZC5SJbHhvM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT29ZEdZ1RArPSd8iwCRmyYofbyVCWGg4RWMQAzpkBLh9", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XKKqyhN7ka8Svg7DBe67hrSWVNcYnrFPM"], "tags": ["asmaulhusna", "religion", "islam", "asmaulhusnanft", "god", "allah", "1of1", "moslem"], "extra": {}}

Fabio FON, 2021.","description":"Video Full HD 1080p, 1min17s . Don’t be a stranger’ is a videopoem created by Fabio FON that departs from the appropriation of clichés images and phrases for a brief narrative based on an escapist dialogue between humans and their planet.  Why, as we live our lives, are we waiting for the planet to be uninhabitable for us and so many other species?  Do we believe in the hypothesis that man-made artificiality is capable of guaranteeing the survival of our specie in the most inhospitable scenario?  The work dialogues with the reflections of Clarissa Ribeiro's curatorship in the project LASER Talks Fortaleza – WE ARE NOT ALONE, Leonardo/ISAST, an initiative in which the videopoem participated in 2021. // More about Fabio FON: fabiofon.com .

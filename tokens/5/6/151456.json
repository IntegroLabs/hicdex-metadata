She guides not only phases in nature, but our hearts and minds. She is also known for guiding menstrual cycles but acts in both feminine and masculine energies. Yin and Yang. She can change personalities, emotions, decisions, and thoughts. Her phases evoke happiness, strength, sadness\u2026 anger. The raw truth, sometimes bitter. She's like a transparent glass and we can see through all her facets. Allow you to become the observer and heal your soul by the energy of this wisdom.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRs9rDQwPmNcpm8p7Qq278rT6QoTZpDeyG5v7XaVaDQAJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPWVvo73QzLQbFEXoFXKVkPCUAc73RooDg2qAPYuk1Y61", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRs9rDQwPmNcpm8p7Qq278rT6QoTZpDeyG5v7XaVaDQAJ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ahsqR53HM9GPB18t4r3SWZbgnCaeA1usq"], "tags": ["watercolor", "painting", "traditional", "moon", "dark", "art", "drawing", ""], "extra": {}}

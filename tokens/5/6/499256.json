In order to get to that point, the population either needs to almost all get infected or a very high percentage of the population needs to be immunized or vaccinated. That being said, during the pandemic The Republican Party and the Trump Administration elected to allow as many people as possible to get infected. This didn't create herd immunity, it created herd mentality for his Cult 45. Herd mentality describes how people can be influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors on a largely emotional, rather than rational, basis. The results are heard imbecility as many of his cult followers refused to get vaccinated and allowed the virus to mutate into much more virulent strains like the Delta variant, that have higher viral loads as well as a higher transmission rate. I like to call this HEARD IMBECILITY. I really don't like to use pejoratives per se, but these individuals warrant some harsh criticism because of their selfish actions that are infecting and potentially killing innocent people, further damaging the economy, and ripping apart the fabric of trust in our society. I'm all about love, compassion, and understanding, but the actions of these individuals are inexcusable, deserve social shaming, and ridicule. Get the fucking shot already and let's end this!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaBej6mUyR2QFHTcCwxPb52EnD5EixXSyeDNBWsPFUMQ1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdQBpy2vb25V91qyj7CCa1peBovTFiCSYcBJLj2W8chFU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaBej6mUyR2QFHTcCwxPb52EnD5EixXSyeDNBWsPFUMQ1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

{"name": "Myth 2: Family", "description": "The mixture of materials and textures, light and shadow, and the contrast between hard and soft objects represent the fragile balance of family relationships. The main shape symbolizes a time line made up of three materials: concrete, wood and liquid that changes from red (life) to blue (death). The organic shapes that surround it symbolize the family union. The scene is created on a small scale and shot with a 140mm macro lens to achieve a soft focus point. Made in Blender.

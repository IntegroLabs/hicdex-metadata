Kasepuhan Sinar Resmi is an important feature of the Ciletuh Geopark's cultural character.\n\nIn the agricultural sector, the Kasepuhan Sinar Resmi community still follows the traditions of their forefathers. From the time rice is planted to the time it is harvested in this traditional community, agricultural celebrations are constantly present.

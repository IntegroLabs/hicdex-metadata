Papuanus captures sunlight and turns into food just like plants, then its frog-like legs spread the fruits to the surrounding areas, which contain hundreds of seeds, making it possible to perpetuate the species.\nThe two heads of Papuanus each have a large brain, so they can communicate with all the other creatures on the planet through its roots, in order to keep the balance of the ecosystem. \n  ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTj7T7zJaveWjcsEqDGPrQreqk84b6SkLvZzQw3LT1z1M", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQMEWkqQyVpNX99sTveNccrgxgXN42wPUZ7kea38U1btg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTj7T7zJaveWjcsEqDGPrQreqk84b6SkLvZzQw3LT1z1M", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Ro3NdaGmfMq9jZNtMUQnWMmA1goKiXPSv"], "tags": ["darwin", "nft", "crypto"], "extra": {}}

The majority of my work is urban and street inspired BUT I do have a deep connection to where my family originates which is the Hawaiian Islands. So I am greatly inspired by the flora and fauna of the islands as well as the historical connection the Hawaiian people have to the ocean. Sometimes you can forget the importance of your loved ones which 100% includes people that aren't actual blood relatives and this piece is a reminder that ones Ohana can be near and far but make sure you take the time to let them know they matter. This is an actual photo of my wife and me on the day of our wedding in Kona, Hawaii. We only invited around 20 people, many of whom were elderly relatives of mine, and in the 10 years since we got married 5 of the people that were there have passed away. The point is, life is short, nurture your relationships and don't ever assume you'll have a tomorrow. Happy Birthday!

{"name": "Myth 1: Sadness ", "description": "For this piece, the intention was to create a sculpture that represents the emotional complexity of sadness from a refined and ironic aesthetic point of view. The color gradients represent the passage between different emotions, the different applied materials constitute the complex identity of the human being and the lighting presents the object as something desirable.   It is your outer face, the one that is presentable to others and the one that receives approval while hiding the truth. 2160\u00d72700 pixels / 96x76 cms.

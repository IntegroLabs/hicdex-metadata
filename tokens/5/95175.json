The equations that govern this are deterministic, yet the task is impossible, and small errors feed forward and lead to total unpredictability. IN THIS SKETCH we see an example of a seemingly stable system. A rare outcome, not unlike our closest galactic neighbor, Alpha Centauri. I don't know how long this system remains stable. My simulation does not yet have access to these timescales, but I'm working on it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ8MEemUhJ4idicB9rdQU9r615bRMxosBrBMa9SJUk6pT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1ZBMhTa7gxSpaeXoqyc6bTCrxEHfZYSpPt"], "tags": ["gif", "animated", "3bodyprob", "physics", "dither", "pixelart"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/gif", "uri": "ipfs://QmZ8MEemUhJ4idicB9rdQU9r615bRMxosBrBMa9SJUk6pT"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmRNwE3xC7qUpTr2iCRvWbBFafk8uDT9QMj8F67e2gP72K"}, "supply": "1", "transfered": 1}

I love to capture the wonder and awe of the moments when I pause to witness life and nature. This photo is from Roberts Creek, BC, Canada. I have spent many years there and still return to visit. There, every sunset presents a new experience. | lucasgaudette.com @lucasgaudette","tags":["nature","photography","mountains","sun","sunset","seagulls","birds","waves","ocean","bay","westcoast","fully","clouds","gold","blue"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmNPsgr1R5isSn7oeNyAB1ZCm6b4fbUTBBvGPtmyqotpKC"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNPsgr1R5isSn7oeNyAB1ZCm6b4fbUTBBvGPtmyqotpKC","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

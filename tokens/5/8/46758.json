I particularly like the illusion of the couple that appears terrified by the ghost bus. It was shot on an L16, which is a CRAZYYY looking camera with 16 lenses on the front (Google: “L16 camera” if you want to see the camera). FYI: My birthday is May 27, the same date as my Harvard 2021 Commencement and graduation!","tags":["PHOTO","DIGITALPHOTO","LONGEXPOSURE","NIGHTSHOT","URBAN","BOSTON","LIGHTING","BUS","TRANSPORTATION"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmVj3Ng7VCyJ2BTokW6wKNZd4tsTHgku6QJXywpahxv4jN"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVj3Ng7VCyJ2BTokW6wKNZd4tsTHgku6QJXywpahxv4jN","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdVvNPxLqyEr7HSKTjfgxuZZJ99pVgG7psycLowyi7rxK","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

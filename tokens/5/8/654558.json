In each of his works, the spectator is absorbed by the audiovisual proposal. Almost like being suspended in a kind of meditation. In addition to being an incredible artist he is a friend, one of the first I met in this landscape and who has been very supportive with me. He is truly an unbelievable person. For this special song he said to me to do whatever I want, to put my mind in blank and create. And that it\u00b4s what I did, I wanted to explore some different kind of musical places. Here's what I brought back from that exploratory trip\u2026 \n\nDibaxu // tw: @dibaxuP\n\n*This is a collection of special and dedicated song for those collectors that get #1, #2, #3 and #4 for my \u201cAnnotations\u201d collection. If you get it, let me know and I will do something special for you, this is a lifetime offer. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUZpqroKnELxPT78hJt5EzynEdv32UwMDdveuN3zwUiYY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSwWWFiVMRVgGWRDk6yQoNB5WRMqBMpVecG8m7pSyaBhy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUZpqroKnELxPT78hJt5EzynEdv32UwMDdveuN3zwUiYY", "mimeType": "audio/wav", "compressedAudioUri": "ipfs://QmWwoHtqm6oVyj1HjGFQhK24uTmpYdtbK4G5MPVcv2N1WG", "coverThumbUri": "ipfs://QmRYRn2B9GTPSt7xVVEP3ZCYipetC4CwJ34HbkkdtyQKgH"}], "creators": ["tz2GcPcbHpnmTgYxfkBT2TxGv5YQMKfptPca"], "tags": ["producer", "musician", "beat", "music", "collection", "dibaxu", "song", "bass", "electronic", "modular", ""], "extra": {}}

The basic \"PseudoRandom\" is creating vertices to generate polylines with the \"MetaBall Algorithm\". The only grayscale gamma is used.  \"Pattern Standardization\" series of \"MetaBall\" structure transformed into abstract 3d. The \"centroids\" of the result polylines are used to generate a crystal structure with \"delaunay\" system inside. \"Cross connected live patterns\". Seed number is changed. The virtual camera is started to fly. The algorithm`s \"seed number\" is possible to transform for new \"landscape variation\". The number of polylines (a lanscape resolution)  is possible to change. The \"voronoi\" cells are added to the environment. The \"path\" is highlighted.

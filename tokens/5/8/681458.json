(no Photoshop! only minimal Lightroom editing, a little contrast, a little noise reduction, a little contrast) I was recovering from having died and been in a coma I was not supposed to wake up from. I fought for my life for 6 months on insane amounts of oxycontin to manage the pain I was in. My world was a blur from the opiates, and I used the creative rush to make a series of abstract photos that mirrored what my world looked like in that drugged up state. I call the collection 'Comatose Vision' ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTGbyvnLJmcXsWaWgXzzUq2FBHHaNTjZgUMhex5Q7eugB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPGh5ZDSw4fAQCeaEKNR8ERK49jSSgArKRGcnKkx8ucBw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTGbyvnLJmcXsWaWgXzzUq2FBHHaNTjZgUMhex5Q7eugB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Lii2aK246Q2J2WquMdmqnGESSBm2hVPKz"], "tags": ["abstract-photography"], "extra": {}}

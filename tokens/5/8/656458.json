Coming nearly two years after their landmark sophomore LP, \u201cIt Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back\u201d, the album is regarded by many to be a pinnacle of political hip hop. Propelled by the production wizardry of The Bomb Squad (Chuck D, Eric Sadler, Keith and Hank Shocklee), it was an explosive hour-long barrage of multi-layered samples and thunderous break-beats. \n\nArguably the loudest and most chaotic rap album of its time, \u201cFear of a Black Planet\u201d still resonates as powerfully today as it did 32 years ago. It features iconic provocative lines that have had a cultural impact that\u2019s gone beyond just lyrics and entered the cultural landscape of grass-root resistance. This is an album that took the concept of violently tearing down the power structure status-quo, and pair it with the HARDEST production anyone could possibly made at the time. While it might not be Public Enemy\u2019s best work, it\u2019s among the greatest hip hop albums ever released.    \n \nCard is made from Fear Of A Black Planet cover art.\n\nFigure is made from repainted Hasbro\u2019s Black Series Stormtrooper figure, repainted Legacy Collection Princess Leia figure, and Ed Piskor\u2019s Public Enemy S1W figure.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNnuEx5AdoppjiX5AYZTKyP8sPCsH6P1gfszEDnLcS7LG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPJiFEiMp3C31v1hTwnf9o2FEyP4vwnpQgntQoKmPZ7MW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNnuEx5AdoppjiX5AYZTKyP8sPCsH6P1gfszEDnLcS7LG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aXpmExefGTPY8Zw8WtaLyKK7AzdsvbZw2"], "tags": ["Digital", "Collage", "HipHop", "Albumart"], "extra": {}}

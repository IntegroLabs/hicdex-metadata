This image, embodied by a camera filled with the memories of the person I care about, is the view I see and be fascinated every time I look out of the window of my house.\nIt makes me feel how peaceful and happy the space I created is. Any place that reminds me of my lover, my two dogs and my three cats and makes me think about their existence, their place in my heart.\n                I look out from my window, see this view\n                I'm in my comfort zone, I find peace.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaNUEBKKe4vzwEYmDuF9teriQwMekLicCeV6AFRVTVEKi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaorQgiXEBBx1ARVCgC86w7VAdVAsi4kKtjdrkHSmX3Vi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaNUEBKKe4vzwEYmDuF9teriQwMekLicCeV6AFRVTVEKi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ebwAsajKqR6MJztmScqLFKvMg13gCSK2Y"], "tags": ["photography", "vhs", "art", "view", "landscape", "nature", "home", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", ""], "extra": {}}

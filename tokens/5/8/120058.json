Outside by the stairs. You were with your friends. We were so young. You looked happy. I didn't stop. I came back around but you were gone. Somebody else was there. New days brought new strangers and soon your corner was everybody's corner. A place to stand. A place to talk. A place to be. Until it wasn't. It's usually empty now. Memories haunt like ghosts. Their only request, stop killing us.

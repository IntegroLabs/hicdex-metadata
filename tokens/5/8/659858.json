{"__version": 1, "token_id": 659858, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "UNVEILED / LIVE NUDE", "description": "Is it a coincidence that an anagram of UNVEILED is LIVE NUDE? Probably, but I thought it was time to add a little sex appeal to the book. Sex sells right? But in all seriousness, there really is a certain sensuality to how the lines caress and intertwine with each other as if in the throes of passionate love. There is a truth about a live nude being unveiled. To get naked or nude, one needs to disrobe and reveal their birthday suit to whomever or to no one, thus unveiling in a sense. Hopefully one day the world will be a home to only sex positive people and zero body shaming. It's sad that so many people have hang-ups about sex and/or talking about it. Sex is one of the most nature things a human being can do; it's what made most of us. Be part of the conversation. Be part of humanity. Be part of what makes you unique. Listen to our bodies; our hearts, our minds; our loins.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZbXbUkWiexoDHVyM1MNBzgBwX5eiY3NLCRx3oHmsbcAj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfXW8zk1LMAckUQnHnJKGauwY3dYM7EiEHyfi6dd94ikT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZbXbUkWiexoDHVyM1MNBzgBwX5eiY3NLCRx3oHmsbcAj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

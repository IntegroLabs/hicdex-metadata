It talks about originality, uniqueness, which for so long was a significant criterion in determining historical movements in the body of art. The world of NFTs is revolutionizing our form of aesthetic perception, putting us back in tradition under another format. The work tells us that the uniqueness of the work no longer needs to exist, but only the uniqueness of property, and that the digital artwork, unlike any other material object, can be in more than one place simultaneously.

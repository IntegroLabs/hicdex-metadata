It was the first time i experienced something weird and surreal but beautiful. I still remember those patterns it made.  I wanted to remake something similar to the one i saw years ago.  Made in After Effects using different animated shape layers and the kaleidoscope effect added on top to create this beautiful artwork.  Fireworks XII is a part of my Kaleida collection on Rarible [please check it out].  And similar to what i did on Rarible, the collectors of Fireworks II are eligible to win an edition from the ETH Firework Collection.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTJbNMoYn2bzN7zoopfCLoJ7ewHmzoFvvJmLkgWSeHiLM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdTLaTRuqvV1pUKAq6LvXH3pnovxZqRV7RrWNXmS7FhJH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTJbNMoYn2bzN7zoopfCLoJ7ewHmzoFvvJmLkgWSeHiLM", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WYwmHFWcz5gmmfLCoUmoKXhWsy7GWnzAf"], "tags": ["pattern", "abstract", "kaleida", "2d", ""], "extra": {}}

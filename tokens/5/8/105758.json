There is always something special in the ordinary. Perspective and context can shape the most common aspects of life into beautiful constellations. The acknowledgement of aleatory and serendipity within the ordinary is where surprises may emerge.  The nft comes with the original drawing, international shipping included. Upon resale on the secondary market the original drawing shall be sent to the new owner. Shipping will be covered by the new owner.   25.11.2018, 36x48cm, 1/1, Artist: Marcel Schwittlick (@schwittlick_)","tags":["plotter","drawing","cursor","üê≠"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmNbU2FcwEdxpapooyiCUYM1DMEAUAD2V1dX3Z3Q2wmBJu"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNbU2FcwEdxpapooyiCUYM1DMEAUAD2V1dX3Z3Q2wmBJu","display_uri":"ipfs://Qmc3BZvYwfdYn9pK5Cn5DXu8pZreAQwjMmZoKeKTwvvk7p","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

The flighty behavior of these birds, made the word \"hen\" to be used as fearful. And in Art it is a symbol of vigilance and activity. For this reason it is found in ancient monuments among the attributes of Minerva, Mercury, Asclepius and many others.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVcNvPa3tvEFozuXxmJTBS5hn4ELmHBS3t33WbKZHQiXN","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZeUqXbSzXZELbeMirnccbtkJMD27ubjJeCYNihGqYNGN","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1awNfZ5aNJPQMYCZXdB9cPXq9KeaEQhq55"],"tags":["Hen","Eggs","fables","illustration","mare"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmVcNvPa3tvEFozuXxmJTBS5hn4ELmHBS3t33WbKZHQiXN"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmSUhX1GG7VR45uFjs4VjZuBVMAVFVkxsEMtC2mAyVxPAx"},"supply":"10","transfered":5}

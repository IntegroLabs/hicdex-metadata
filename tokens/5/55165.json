It also was the calmest - no subway workers were bothering us and we had our time. Love how Margo interacts with the surroundings emphasizing the verticality of the columns. Also I enjoyed creamy-goldish tones of the interior and interesting use of light in the walls. Shot on Kodak Portra 400 film with 1978 Canon AE-1 manual camera.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmb7UPDxzHMDdWwdCsqMBJeugVyhWbp6sjFUrHf8Yqxt7p","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1T79QVHD4dw3B85vWENHLC1j3tA82eqgJS"],"tags":["35MM","FILM","PHOTOGRAPHY","ANALOGUE","METRO","SUBWAY","KYIV","UKRAINE","ARCHITECTURE","PORTRAIT"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmb7UPDxzHMDdWwdCsqMBJeugVyhWbp6sjFUrHf8Yqxt7p"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmQoQioYt19PR9UJrjG38615HkF7ifXriAk4tvTdHYxLyJ"},"supply":"20","transfered":17}

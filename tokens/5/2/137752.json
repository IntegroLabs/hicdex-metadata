This one, letâ€™s call her Mrs. Lam, decided to fly over to Japan to try some ramen. Eats: grasses. But now also ramen. Not really fond of sushi, she says tempura prawns were cool though.

Because why not.","tags":["llama","animal","vaporwave","synthwave","japan","retro"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmQNRurPKUMnp6ZpP3kxnxgaBbdrXxXgPrir3YHdg11oUH","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQNRurPKUMnp6ZpP3kxnxgaBbdrXxXgPrir3YHdg11oUH","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNvxn6261kyFAtEBKrYu6r8mHFNdvcpMBJCdTUqREfpxd","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

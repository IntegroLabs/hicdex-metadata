Being in a new location triggered a sensory overload and a fear of missing out. One of the most beautiful sunsets of my life had just started and I couldn't miss it.\nNature began its show: The breeze got colder, the sunbeams dimmed and the Sun began to pour its gold over the mountains. Then, in its final act, the Sun lit up the face of the last mountain and was gone.\n\nThe PARNASO Series is about being connected to the nature and overcoming limits. It consists of photographs taken in and around the Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National Park ('Parque Nacional da Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os' in portuguese or its abbreviation 'PARNASO'), located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and covering a huge area across four municipalities.\n\nEquipment: Sony Alpha A6500 + Sony E 18-135mm F/3.5-5.6 OSS\nLocation: Petr\u00f3polis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQoVv6ZdofFqxt5B5hSBKnREJKnn2jsytx5tADgt1j2xJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd2wFyhPRwudP78kqR3P82HE6BpSE7jR8uF4vmrwMTGEk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQoVv6ZdofFqxt5B5hSBKnREJKnn2jsytx5tADgt1j2xJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1V6koMbi6iWRpgrh9ULh6M2R7QhBgwGcjn"], "tags": ["lit", "green", "golden", "parnaso", "nationalpark", "mountain", "forest", "nature", "atlanticforest", "rainforest", "landscape", "landscapephotography", "feelthephoto", "petropolis", "rio", "riodejaneiro", "brazil", "madeinbrazil"], "extra": {}}

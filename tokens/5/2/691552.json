Looks like we are on a roll with these color puns. Playing on the word figment, we've replaced it with pigment, which is another word for any material that is imbued with saturated color. Nothing gives me more happiness than watching grown people read a horrible color pun and either react with an audible giggle or a subtle sigh laced with utter contempt. What I'm getting at is that I don't care what the reaction is, just feel something. If this art doesn't make you feel something, keep looking at more art until something does. Believe it or not everyone has the ability to have some sort of aesthetic, even if you are not an art buff. Art is accessible to everyone. Sometimes art is serious with intense subject matter and sometimes it can be humorous. Art can be about something, nothing, or just about anything.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaXpBhvmg8XY8Nt3hSAmopbZdJbMJ6XBCMpSrvUqudReq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXnpP43ussYshcjgKYd6G4gZpSrBiZW2KC6xbXPa1EgoT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaXpBhvmg8XY8Nt3hSAmopbZdJbMJ6XBCMpSrvUqudReq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

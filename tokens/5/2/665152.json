One of my favorite desserts is Spanish flan. Between the taste of the condensed milk, the caramel, and the texture of the vanilla custard...it's just a perfect 10. Though flan isn't a pie at all, the thought of flan got me on this sweets kick and it made me think of this anagram. That being said, I have never tried a Tarta de Manzana Casera. (A Spanish apple tart/pie made the most of sweet and tart apples with a flaky, puffy pastry and some sticky apricot preserves, sometimes arranged with the apple slices in a nice spiral pattern.) But, if I was able to try this, I'm pretty sure this would qualify as the very definition of HAPPINESS IS SPANISH PIES statement. That and I probably would go into a sugar coma from the deliciousness, Now is this art you ask? Yes. Yes it is. My memories of flan and the future conceptual memories of what this pie tastes like converge into this work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcvu3Vcgvkmt4TE9dgTAAHMoMwoaY2yshNGPNkTg6A1nd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWCyZXguet4xQCvAds98cd58s6JVPiPMVFDsmBTH8h1Pi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcvu3Vcgvkmt4TE9dgTAAHMoMwoaY2yshNGPNkTg6A1nd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

The displayed waveform can then be analyzed for properties such as amplitude, frequency, rise time, time interval, distortion, and others.","tags":["oscilloscope","vcvrack"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmW9tgkHrDfEfPDRDg4mG77n7CqoE64DU6EaiX14ZXwsLw","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmW9tgkHrDfEfPDRDg4mG77n7CqoE64DU6EaiX14ZXwsLw","display_uri":"ipfs://QmW9tgkHrDfEfPDRDg4mG77n7CqoE64DU6EaiX14ZXwsLw","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

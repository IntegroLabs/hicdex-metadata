It was bought in California, where it was designed. It also travelled to China, where it was manufactured. Many trips, many events, many stickers. Several important projects came from it here in Brazil, I'm very grateful. After some months living near the beach, during the pandemic, it oxidated and a short circuit burned the motherboard and other eletronics. Total loss. Today I will give the screen to a friend. I will try to convince her to keep these stickers, it's like an NFT. But is totally her decision. Now it will be forever in tezos blockchain as a hic et nunc objkt. Thanks <3","tags":["studio","lifelog","macbook","stickers"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmX6HCavbt4rGrBQvNRC1xk8mfd7qqzF78fGt6QnAAyPc7"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmX6HCavbt4rGrBQvNRC1xk8mfd7qqzF78fGt6QnAAyPc7","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

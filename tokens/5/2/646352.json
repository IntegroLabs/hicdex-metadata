Unlike everyone else, especially when compared to the group of skaters from her school, she was incredibly daring with the way she would skate, intentionally going out of her way to attempt tricks that no sane person would even try.\n \nIn a way, it was almost like she enjoyed being reckless, just to test her own boundaries. Some of her stunts could be considered dangerous, but she would cross the line so close to being harmful that it almost seemed as if she were daring herself to skate like nobody else could.\n \nThat particular day, she continued to go through her routine, going faster and faster as her stunts became more daring. It seemed as if she was going to try something impossible, judging by the expression on her face, but it was impossible to know what she was thinking. It was doubtful that she even knew. There was a feeling of joy in her heart when she skated, and that was all that was important. She was getting to live in the moment, and that was all that mattered to her.\n \n\u2014---\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied. Gold frames have the lowest mint rate of the initial 3. All artworks will be compatible within the Gallery Gehenna Game with each artwork unlocking a playable story segment.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSBJmFmAtnttcFnoik372yHmWvGcQfdcFeMdqvtVpwFNs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYPzBz7GC6BtoJKNGdZZpPtKM6ih13cnT42PPe8tNwETb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSBJmFmAtnttcFnoik372yHmWvGcQfdcFeMdqvtVpwFNs", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2KTcdaM1hm8d8K9pnBu6dsD6v38bjyXDAP"], "tags": ["NeuralNetwork", "NeuralArt", "AIArt", "AIEnhancedArt", "AIColors", "Skateboarding", "Skateboard", "Crazy", "CrazyTrick", "Ollie", "SkateboardJump", "Sports", "Story", "GalleryGehenna", "GalleryGehennaNFT", "GalleryGehennaProject", ""], "extra": {}}

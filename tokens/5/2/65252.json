I have since forgotten what the prompt was, but this story remains, by far, my favorite out of all the stories that I've written in 2020. It is inspired by the love stories we hear from myths, but because I'm a romantic, this story ends in a more hopeful note. Words, design, and layout by me.","tags":["fiction","fantasy","shortstory","PDF","cryptowriting","cryptowriter","cryptoliterature"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"application/pdf","uri":"ipfs://QmaN2BJLpYVpwcRCTx7E8jxVVEpbtAt7bnGwyWt79NAoBa"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaN2BJLpYVpwcRCTx7E8jxVVEpbtAt7bnGwyWt79NAoBa","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Words, design, and layout by me.","tags":["fiction","fantasy","shortstory","PDF","cryptowriting","cryptowriter","cryptoliterature"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"application/pdf","uri":"ipfs://QmaN2BJLpYVpwcRCTx7E8jxVVEpbtAt7bnGwyWt79NAoBa"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaN2BJLpYVpwcRCTx7E8jxVVEpbtAt7bnGwyWt79NAoBa","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZe1Wks937oUQEvgXcAKHC56NZyCdfEFpiwGEvtXvTYaU","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

You can own excerpts of this living experience that is streamed 24/7 on youtube. It is an ephemeral installation in which it is not possible to experience the past, only the present.  You can order a recording of any specific time in the future (such as a significant date). Just hit me up on twitter or e-mail and we can arrange it.","tags":["COVID","Piano","Twitter","Tweets","Pandemic","datasonification","soundart"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmPcWRZxUohcv8GemBgK2AwSBZuu24Fboo5anRdn4U7FCS"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPcWRZxUohcv8GemBgK2AwSBZuu24Fboo5anRdn4U7FCS","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

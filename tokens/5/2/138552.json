The bag in the photo is from one of the most expensive shops in the UK, Harrods of London, while the syringe and drug paraphernalia were in situ on top of this bag. I feel this is a powerful metaphor for the economic divide across the world and in the UK right now. How did the bag get to an abandoned warehouse over 100 miles away? What happened to the people who used to visit or live in this warehouse now it is gone?

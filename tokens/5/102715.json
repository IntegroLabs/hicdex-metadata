It is the result of a process involving random values. Therefore it will never be possible to recreate it again. And that makes it fascinating.   The beauty comes from the randomness of the parameter values themselves.  The Universe being almost infinite, I like to think that somewhere, at some time between the big bang and now a Nebula looking exactly like this one exists. Or it may not be there yet, but given the infinity of time the Universe has left, it will exist.  I hope you enjoy it and get lost in the depths of this Nebula which contains hundreds of thousands of stars and planets.  /// Art by @hello_im_flo", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcpw47kAMwqHXjSGfCVKADhuNW4zLCyvjNVu48CRCzCiV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXkZnEftanqh7vSiyiDM8au6uMBgaftU1hiej1tfwtp9d", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1UTeoj8st1ModBmBtm8Ev1RDy3LoJGGNfM"], "tags": ["generativeart", "generative", "touchdesigner", "creativecoding", "creative", "genart", "codeart", "creativecoding", "creativeart", "programmingart", "newmedia", "newmediaart", "digitalart", "space", "nebula", "galaxy", "astronomy", "universe", "planets", "stars", "supernova"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://Qmcpw47kAMwqHXjSGfCVKADhuNW4zLCyvjNVu48CRCzCiV"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmUWuhyP9AzT1xyJREkLmahLv7t71Po2qoqbArLh8VQSS4"}, "supply": "5", "transfered": 8}

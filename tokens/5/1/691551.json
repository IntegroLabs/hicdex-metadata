Well, the word zipper itself isn't indignant, at least I hope not. I created it! lol It's the fusion of the color INDIGO and an ANT. Random thought, but can you just imagine an indigo colored ant? That would be spectacular. (But Andrew...INDIGO and ANT don't spell INDIGNANT.) True, but we simply switch the \"O\" to an \"N\" as if it were a word ladder and et viola, instant indignance! There are many tricks and loopholes that are readily available to all of us; we just need to be sensitive and see the patterns.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme1gyxpgGRGVg6S3o1WjvXvxfmPTrHovqKe6yvCA981hn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSYvLaLt229Cm1Nb4sbZKJ8UnzsxeV2wPk7oJqziWNn1H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme1gyxpgGRGVg6S3o1WjvXvxfmPTrHovqKe6yvCA981hn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

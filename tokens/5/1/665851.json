I've always had a thing for power lines and electric transformers. I have included several photos of transformers in previous layouts, but I had made a series of photos in undergrad that we had to color enlarge ourselves. Most people are familiar with black and white dark rooms but with color enlargers you have to perfectly balance the 3 RGB filters, in COMPLETE DARKNESS. The series had 10-14x11 photos all featuring power lines and transformers, I hadn't seen the photos in 20 years and then I stumbled onto them while I was searching through my old college files. Todays design features portions of 4 of those photos taken in Buffalo NY in the Fall of 2001. I always loved the stark contrast the lines would make against the sky and the shapes the transformers would create adjacent to each other. These same factors made for some amazing fodder for todays design.

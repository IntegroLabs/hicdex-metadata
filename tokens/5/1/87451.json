It has several eyes and a formless, constantly shifting shape. It's size can range from that of an ant, to the size of a male adults hand, seemingly able to shift at will. Highly aggressive, if others emerge, do not attempt to contain in anything other than composite 7-63. It has a huge appetite for inorganic materials.","tags":["Burning","Hot","Lore","Story","3D","Blender","Animation"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmWi9aQ5oc3E6A98iffhpHkQPPH2DHoRhX3CDpE5ifLr1H"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWi9aQ5oc3E6A98iffhpHkQPPH2DHoRhX3CDpE5ifLr1H","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

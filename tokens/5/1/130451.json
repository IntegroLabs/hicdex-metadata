This timelapse, shot through my rooftop telescope, shows over 2 hours of rotation of the planet. Over 40 master frames were individually processed for this animation, each of which was obtained by stacking the top 30% frames of a 4000 frames capture, with each capture being taken with a 2 minute interval.","tags":["Jupiter","Planets","SolarSystem","Telescope","Timelapse","Cosmos","Space","Universe","Astronomy","Astrophotography"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmNpSopVA1CRpfceEbuZzvfNP3qzaZyfhoyZc7bA83Jjko","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNpSopVA1CRpfceEbuZzvfNP3qzaZyfhoyZc7bA83Jjko","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNpSopVA1CRpfceEbuZzvfNP3qzaZyfhoyZc7bA83Jjko","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

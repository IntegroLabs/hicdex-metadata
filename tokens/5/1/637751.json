Hopefully this NFT can be a hope for me to stay at Opensea. I hope you guys like my projects and buy some of them.\n\nMy new project is called Spaceman Invasion. What's that ? Spaceman Invasion is when spaceman gets attack from aliens and all of them die. An alien occupied the space plan, and ate it to their bones, and left the space suit. And some of the aliens are wearing spacesuits whose spaceships have been eaten by them.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmctrmm4hVrQrF8VpEBixsdBTWUHZL71muXpKbTFDKG1FA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPZqqgBaeFpJ5n8FuwU4ZZMutxGrjDXf8waMw3NgsSBsH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmctrmm4hVrQrF8VpEBixsdBTWUHZL71muXpKbTFDKG1FA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2TiQAa9yqYN3a2W4jK6A43N47S8DhyWDaR"], "tags": ["SpacemanInvasion", "Alien", "Astronaut"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 652051, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Occluded Squares with Multiple Line Widths on a Square Grid", "description": "This animation is made with Nodebox. Nodebox is a node-based visual language for generative art based on Python. It is a loop of 100 frames with a resolution of 1000 x 1000 pixels.\n\nThis is a \u2018plottable artwork\u2019. Which means it can be drawn by a machine: a penplotter. I am happy to deliver a physical drawing after purchase. A purchase of this edition of 100 serves as a token to order a physical pen plotter drawing of a single frame of the animation (So upon resale on the secondary market the physical edition might turn to be larger). \n\nIn this case transfer 10 tez to florisdejonge.tez (from the same address as the one owning the NFT) to cover the materials and shipping. Feel free to contact me via twitter.com/floris_de_jonge or instagram.com/dejongefloris/. Pictures of plotted designs can be seen there as well. \n\nThis design is plotted with white Rotring ink using an Isograph 0.6 pen on ClaireFontaine Troph\u00e9e Black 210 grams A4 paper. Because a pen plot is created with a real pen on real paper the physical properties of the material contribute to the appearance of the artwork. Therefore small imperfections are part of the work.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcfbvavBALASH1Vk37pz415b7N5wtSKQnBW8uzsbT5B4a", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT3BKgn8f4rW9L9Tk4TpSe31ifngMPoJh9nvWy4kTsntx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcfbvavBALASH1Vk37pz415b7N5wtSKQnBW8uzsbT5B4a", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SHteAqHWkCUKvHGTNScNyuZLw4vd43jse"], "tags": ["Generative", "plot", "penplotter", "svg", "vector", "pattern", "geometric", "physical", "IRL", "NFT"], "extra": {}}

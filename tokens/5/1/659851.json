There's something about the inherent quality of a diptych that either creates contrast or adds harmony to a work of art. In the case of the following two works, we can put them together to create a larger narrative about time. Conceptual art fun exercise moment! Who's in? (I don't see enough hands out there, but ok we'll go for it.) Imagine these two works side by side with a space in between them. You are the space in between. This work is THE PAST IS THE FUTURE and the next page is THE FUTURE IS THE PAST. We are trapped between the past and the future. We are the past's future primitives; we are also the future's past primitives.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdaT8GEYhnFx2jtdRBkVmrDAz6zBi8CnbzEaUy6uMG4wX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSAXUJZ6JHSzLW29pNmcTp4XMUssQ3ZCJLQtNqi2P2EWs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdaT8GEYhnFx2jtdRBkVmrDAz6zBi8CnbzEaUy6uMG4wX", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

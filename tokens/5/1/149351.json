For science, it is an experience of unconscious imagination during our sleep period. For Freud, night dreams are generated in the search for the fulfillment of a repressed desire. Recently, it has been discovered that even babies in the womb have REM (rapid eye movements) sleep and dream, but it is not known what. In many cultural and religious traditions, the dream appears to be covered with precognitive powers or even an expansion of consciousness.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTP6H4dDzUBq3rwzJKcxb3Zd7yPbfhkVTVkxRmF5RTGvb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSc1MEAZVywbds4Rxo6Qv4z41FbJAUNoEiqcbvDyX82bj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTP6H4dDzUBq3rwzJKcxb3Zd7yPbfhkVTVkxRmF5RTGvb", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1L51KJ6DLz5DNFkRJrWHW9vhMWsZjWWJpu"], "tags": ["Dreams", "DigitalArt", "Art", "3D"], "extra": {}}

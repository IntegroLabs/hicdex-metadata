The quiet people of this place make boxes known for their intricacy and small edges.  On the north eastern edge of Vinestone, where the birchwoods have crept back between the buildings, in the base of a broken tower is what passes for a pub. Amidst ancient and half crumbled walls, local people sing happy songs of places far away.","tags":["stone","maps","tomjohnsonart","embroidery","cartography",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmSq7SVNBEG45dJgoMGUNpq95qk6Qpu72HJQ2hXcqKDsw2"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSq7SVNBEG45dJgoMGUNpq95qk6Qpu72HJQ2hXcqKDsw2","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

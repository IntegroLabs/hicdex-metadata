Amidst ancient and half crumbled walls, local people sing happy songs of places far away.","tags":["stone","maps","tomjohnsonart","embroidery","cartography",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmSq7SVNBEG45dJgoMGUNpq95qk6Qpu72HJQ2hXcqKDsw2"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSq7SVNBEG45dJgoMGUNpq95qk6Qpu72HJQ2hXcqKDsw2","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVPvE3b4WKT5m2nqaR7yoRShY563Rv8rYpyJf4HBTY9Lx","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

A lot of what you wish for now is currently out of reach, that\u2019s why you wish for it. Just just imagine you reaching it automatically just by wishing. Would you know what to do with what you wished for without having the experience you use it wisely? Most of the time, without the experience you\u2019d lose whatever you wished for as fast as you\u2019d reach it. The only way to receive what you are wishing for is when you\u2019re ready. When you\u2019ve been beat up left and right with experiences, then you shall be ready to receive from God. Trust in your journey, the pain you receive during your journey is getting you ready for the blessings you\u2019ve been wishing for. Be patient and have faith! God is getting you ready\u2728", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNPy66vbTzWDaDt1K4qeaiYQEQqG75zpn382AQyGZg85Z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTdEcskmaa876DuzzvkbH2QsUvEZKRH33n2MddFPe67dq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNPy66vbTzWDaDt1K4qeaiYQEQqG75zpn382AQyGZg85Z", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1brtBEGCM8Rak1XrXSbTjah46HwekBzMAj"], "tags": ["AnubisFX", "Collage", "Diamond", "Skull", "Purple", "Trippy", "Psychedelic", "Abstract", "Photoshop", ""], "extra": {}}

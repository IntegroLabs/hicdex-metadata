As I was watching the sunset, I said aloud, \"This is going on forever and ever and ever and ever...\". During my soliloquy to my subconscious, I noticed that the sounds of the words I was speaking started to change. \"and ever and ever and ever\" started to sound like \"endeavor and ever endeavor and ever...\". I instantaneously knew I was onto something. Later that evening I tried to recreate the sunset using \"ENDEAVOR AND EVER\" and changed the colors of the lines to mimic the colors I saw in the sky. If you squint your eyes you can see the sunset; it was magnificent. I'm planning on doing a whole separate series of paintings to recreate sunsets in the future. I'm very excited about this side project. It's one of my favorite works to date and it holds so much meaning to me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNxUDoB8NgMLEwMX5gRWtwnPfweKuu9GQtHzgLPSjTicR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR1SQ37ru4qxk6KXrntuucRdWUz2b81WMercHUF8gFjnB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNxUDoB8NgMLEwMX5gRWtwnPfweKuu9GQtHzgLPSjTicR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

The play deals with the questions emerging while we are walking alone in nature. These photographs are a proposal seeking to capture the attentive slowing down present in the subject of the piece, but also inherent to any work of research and creation.\n\nSince nothing is added to the image afterwards, photography can thus in this case serve both as a faithful object to the work cited and also as a testimony of the transition between the viewer\u2019s gaze and the object observed.\n\nThe project is currently continued with living art companies or artists performing.\n\n________\n\n\n\u00abL\u00e0 o\u00f9 nous sommes\u00bb cast : Conception : Charlotte Braun / Performance : Charlotte Braun, Romain Pellegrini ( Drums ) / Drums composition : Romain Pellegrini / Sound and light creation : Audrey Ruzafa.

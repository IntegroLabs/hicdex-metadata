The digital planet Serpy was a reptilian utopia, until a black hole absorbed the planet. The 1000 surviving Crypto Serpents have entered to the digital world through NFTs. CryptoSerpents are fungible tokens, NFTs, collectibles from the Tezos network.   His goal is to collect as many Tezos as they are adopted by humans and invade their icon on social media to spread his message.   The first drop of 20 CryptoSerpents goes on sale for 1.9 Tezos on May 30, 2021.   Every week there is a new drop of 20 with a maximum of 500 cryptoserpents.   The price of the following drops will be 18 CryptoSerpents that will have the price of the average value of the last sale of all NFTs (except this NFT) and 2 CryptoSerpents of greater value to encourage their price to rise and that the CryptoSerpents rule the world.   When a User buys a CryptoSerpent for a price higher than the average, the average value of the CryptoSerpents goes up.   Thanks for support and lets Dominate!

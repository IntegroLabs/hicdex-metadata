{"__version": 1, "token_id": 663754, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "REVIVER", "description": "REVIVER is another modular cubicle experiment for a syntax crystal. The implied three dimensionality again coaxes us to have a discussion about true perception. Are we seeing blocks piled up or just flat words that look like they're connected by thin purple lines? Do the imaginary negative space push the crystals forward, backward, and/or both? Obviously, you as the viewer can decide. But does the word or meaning of REVIVER have to do with these implied spaces or boxes? That part is easy: absolutely not. As addressed earlier, abstraction doesn't necessarily have to have a narrative. Some narratives are non-objective. We're not trying to tell a story here. The story is that this shape, these word pyramids, the color combination, etc...are a possibility in an endless sea of potentials. As the artist, I felt that this was the best way to express this concept. Given the sequence of the background, this made the most sense and it's layout, symmetrical and soothing.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdWAqRt9KUVrUvaYsVBR76Qq4Gth7436bprcRBgyEjsdV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeBXdVgAELRj3SZrdsV1jeZknuiuaoV2KDJNejKQfKwnx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdWAqRt9KUVrUvaYsVBR76Qq4Gth7436bprcRBgyEjsdV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

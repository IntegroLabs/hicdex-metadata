The scenario has been set and painted for us here. Let's investigate! We have  an overflowing of fuchsia tinted sentences implying a water leak. Someone is on the scene is either making a statement or asking someone else to check a fuchsia box. Check the fuchsia box for what, a tool or something to help with the fuchsia leak? Are they implying that they should be checking a fuse box? If so, why? This is a fuchsia water leak. Why is there a leak? How did it happen? We're left scratching our heads as to what the heck is going on. All we know is that someone needs to check the damn fuchsia box. It's kind of like opening a door and seeing a total disaster happening and then you react by just shutting the door and walking away.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd96Qt6ciD2LQkFcsuMYv5GWUxDsJ99k2v9uJtNDzzttV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYWmewYPzRMEXrm1DURrYCFjGdYNDa2Mc1KUD5MPRXYKr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd96Qt6ciD2LQkFcsuMYv5GWUxDsJ99k2v9uJtNDzzttV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

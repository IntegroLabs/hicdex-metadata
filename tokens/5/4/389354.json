{"__version": 1, "token_id": 389354, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Dream Flag 1", "description": "This was a long dream and I only remember this bit, which was the end. So TWD Season 3 intro plays as normal, as if I'm watching it, I can't see myself though. The only difference is on Steven Yeun's card it shows the driver's seat of Dale's RV with a light-up gaming keyboard under the steering wheel for some reason. Then the dream shifted to the Season 3 group at Hershel's farm in the daytime, trying to get Dale's RV from where it was at the barn. Daryl gets on the roof (he has his long hair for some reason) and cuts a steel wire that was attached between the RV and the barn. And while it isn't clear, I guess the implication is that the noise from the wire was loud, because then it cuts to a bunch of walkers going into what looks like a lake. They look over, then the dream cuts to Glenn (who also has long hair) and it's suddenly nighttime. One of the walkers comes up behind Glenn and bites his shoulder, which I guess kills him because then the dream shifts to the group onboard the Flying Dutchman with only Davy Jones, no one else, during a storm at sea with grey overcast clouds. Hershel points at Davy and says something along the lines of: 'Davy Jones helped kill Dale and Glenn.' To which Davy Jones casually walks off the edge of the Dutchman onto the crow's nest of another, a sunken ship, which was sticking out of the water. This flag was flying above the crow's nest.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUVpMPv8vPp3ns83ca6X2u5H1fqetMQXr312H8g3Cu98K", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXFtA88cvE8ftiKSDCGifb2tA6hN33AqKBUeTjTYVgMQq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUVpMPv8vPp3ns83ca6X2u5H1fqetMQXr312H8g3Cu98K", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Q8jvLmty8z7KDx2vKKjucxAmcBPvJVWNZ"], "tags": ["dreamflag"], "extra": {}}

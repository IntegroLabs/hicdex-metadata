A hopeful, bruise-colored, abstract piece with cascading rectilinear forms. The image suggests steps or descending, overlapping frames that tilt more and more askew as your eye goes from top to bottom, revealing a white glow at the nadir with shards of light reaching for the surface. Beautiful evidence of particles attempting to escape collapsing superpositions in a near-future experiment that shatters the minds of physicists and cosmologists alike. 2000x2700 pixels.

Their species is divided into upper class and lower class by genders. The female part is led by Ma-Sha. They appear to be greatly affected by sexual dimorphism, both in behaviour and appearance. During what was later named \"The Great Passive Aggression\", the female part of the Gazorpian population separated from the male due to their increasingly destructive behaviour. At some point after the separation, the female population created sex robots to mate with the male gazorpians in order to maintain the population. The male population regressed back to highly primitive state where they no longer wear any clothes or utilize an understandable language. The female population, on the other hand, continued to develope into a prosperous society.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmccV3DsjCVMpXPVRF1iKn4cqswQCP214YdcPi7HX3QD2k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmccV3DsjCVMpXPVRF1iKn4cqswQCP214YdcPi7HX3QD2k", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmccV3DsjCVMpXPVRF1iKn4cqswQCP214YdcPi7HX3QD2k", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YFGxvZhjPuX68HHwbRoK75EkMzpgWqCdv"], "tags": ["lilbits", "collectibles", "edibles", "smol", "small", "rickandmorty", "rick&morty", "10x10"], "extra": {}}

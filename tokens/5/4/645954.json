{"__version": 1, "token_id": 645954, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SWITCHERS", "description": "As word pyramid syntax crystals go, this one is WAY out there and that's coming from me. This was an exercise in what was possible with regards to how far I could possibly take an idea. Was it successful? Depends on how we are gauging success. What makes this particular work unique and interesting is when we look at the word SWITCH, if we go to the next level down and add an \"E\", it should say SWITCHE; it doesn't. It reads WITCHES. So what happened here? We simply have added the \"E\" to SWITCH and moved the \"S\" to the end to create the word WITCHES. And if we continue down the pyramid, we notice how the pyramid splits off and forms two completely new word pyramids. It winds up being a curious anomaly that makes me smile. It certainly isn't the prettiest of the bunch, but I love the uniqueness of it. There's lots of wrong answers in terms of making these types of crystals. It takes thought, time, and tenacity to follow through all the way to the end of one of these; patience is key.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZCBejxbsAgLdBLxDGDXejFxT6SABYoc7iy8SBW49H8bs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWVf6i7ouguJoqGi9ekpeUQGMVpaDGw9Xw4DVuPZijshw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZCBejxbsAgLdBLxDGDXejFxT6SABYoc7iy8SBW49H8bs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

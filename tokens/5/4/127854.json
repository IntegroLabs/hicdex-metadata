I was homeless and I made my art on a samsung j3. But I loved it. In 2019, I joined superrare. Lets just say that I spent almost all day, every day, making art and experimenting and exploring. My artwork was all over the place. Unfortunately, I listened to the established artists about the importance of scarcity, and never minted several hundred pieces that I created during that year. I wish I had minted them now. But, better late than never! This piece is pretty self explanatory right. It's a turtle spaceman who is stuck in his own head. He's cute.

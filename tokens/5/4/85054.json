The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-deltoid type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots in the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a nonreversible tremmie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the \"up\" end of the grammeters.","tags":["BDVXP"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmaZDU1pMimBxhNXRsV73cwP84a9JXvmac9hJZaxehSdRK"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaZDU1pMimBxhNXRsV73cwP84a9JXvmac9hJZaxehSdRK","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNNbp9hzafnUHbjBySt8YDtg2v4emYpXEHxTvqiywoeJg","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

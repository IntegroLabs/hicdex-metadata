This is our primal life force, the passionate ever burning fire we have deep within us. I felt this piece was absolutely relevant as my HENthousand exhibition, for it elaborates on what we ALL feel as creators in this alien world of digital art! Regardless of the trials that face us, there still glows within... a deep simmering ultraviolet ember of LOVE FOR CREATION & SHARING that deep feeling soul inside yourself with the community around you. let your prana shine super bright!

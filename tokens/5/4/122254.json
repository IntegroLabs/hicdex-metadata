There is a broad black eye stripe extending from bill to nape of neck. This Kingfisher inhabits woodlands, mangroves, tall open eucalypt forest and melaleuca forest.Often seen perched on branches in the mangrove lined rivers and creeks of Northern Australia during the winter months.I spotted this one on the Mossman river just north of Port Douglas, Australia.The sun started to set giving it a warm glow.

These arts are to raise funds to get a wellness checkup done for her. The cost for her diagnosis is $73.50 and glucose curve $30 at Westbury Animal Hospital.   The cat in my care is my partner that I hand-rescued as a scrawny abandoned kitten. Kitty affectionately greets humans by coming up to lick them. She is irreplaceable so I'd do anything for her sake.  Cats are high protein carnivores and die if they do not eat for 3-4 days. Day 1 she was doing deathbed rituals of vomiting 5+ times and starving and hiding in dark places. Day 2 she didn't eat until night and vomited it up. Day 3 she thankfully stopped starving but had two large vomits. We dodged a bullet which I feared may come to, that it seems she did not have to incur thousands of dollars of ICU care like she had last time she went into ketoacidosis with the same symptoms.  I've been trying to get an official invoice record of the quote for 3 days in different ways from my animal hospital. They've said they've sent it but I've never received it on my end. I can not be upset with the hospital because they receive near-death animals on a regular basis and are constantly in high pressure.  Prices are tiered so you can contribute however much is an comfortable amount. Any extras will be donated to a cat charity with screenshots. I also support cats by publishing diabetic cat care videos.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWacAwyvUrUnSyRzP4c7CPhoKPKkhEgLkBjH9cSN5WSkE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV9ifpo8VFXRP52vzzrG9ooPqZUnpk1LmK25BCtGXA985", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWacAwyvUrUnSyRzP4c7CPhoKPKkhEgLkBjH9cSN5WSkE", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iYscUrVENwYToWf3tCnxQWzK8acxVF43a"], "tags": ["cat", "fundraiser"], "extra": {}}

Old oak floor boards creak underfoot, as you walk down this rickhouse corridor at Barton Distillery. The rich fragrance of aging bourbon hangs heavy in the air, along with the humidity of a Kentucky summer.\n\nBuilt in 1879, Barton Distillery is the oldest fully-operational distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky. Visitors can walk the distillery grounds, and tour several structures, including this rickhouse, where bourbon rests in charred oak barrels to age.\n\n#9 in the \"Inviting You Through\" series, a collection of windows, archways, and covered passages, which will invite you to look or travel through them, to see what's on the other side, or simply enjoy the journey of getting there.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmck6N5vykJXZDmaDWNx7zKvMRNaubPQTm6zdDzeDnSVib", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUw7oPdohhQhFuBivrDp2XkDRdwrw7TMFgmYDbnJvD3ss", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmck6N5vykJXZDmaDWNx7zKvMRNaubPQTm6zdDzeDnSVib", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz29ZRzr7Le6QHCpj3WwH67bEBZhfb1edpEo"], "tags": ["digital", "photography", "distillery", "barton", "bourbon", "kentucky", "barrels", "corridor"], "extra": {}}

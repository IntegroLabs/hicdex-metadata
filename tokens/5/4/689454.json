He hovered around until he disintegrated into tears. His nightmares are the flowers that grow by the spring; they emerge from the center of the earth, piercing layers and layers of roots and stones. It is said that they tempt anyone who smells them to become living corpses, unable to show love.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfK3TbudhazLGv5ksJ9sTcmKBuff4f78pcywpk8gKReCD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVi1H5WNfR7VbnswQ28GvCe81GYjxtc1BnhUyaffWeqVV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmXNr3AJDQpkYUREcS9ZiwfBn8ZZgmHAkPVUHjLmPE474V", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfK3TbudhazLGv5ksJ9sTcmKBuff4f78pcywpk8gKReCD", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YX3wbJYuYJTMJddu8i47uhULfJNhSBU1o"], "tags": ["cuteartsadnessisrebelionmagickalgirl"], "extra": {}}

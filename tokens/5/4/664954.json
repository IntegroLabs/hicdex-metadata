{"__version": 1, "token_id": 664954, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Model M400", "description": "Roger Tallon designed Model M400 Adjustable Helicoid Spiral Staircase in 1964.\n\nOne of the leading figures of French industrialization, Tallon studied engineering in Paris and later taught at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, where he co-founded the Department of Design. Tallon is mainly known for his work with the French National Railway. He worked on TGV bullet trains, designing carriage interiors, brand identity and everything in between and later became Design Director of the Eurostar.\n\nThe stair has a central steel pole on which cast aluminium steps are stacked and attached with two screws. Three different stair widths were designed, ranging from 550mm to 900mm. There is also a wide landing stair; all steps have a rubber inlay. \n\nThe assembly also includes spacers and baseplates but no handrail, opening up opportunities for bespoke solutions.\n\nThe stair is 1400mm in diameter and can extend up to 4m in height.\n\nThe M400 is still in production. In 1986 Sentou acquired exclusive distribution rights and are selling it for \u20ac10,000. You can also get used individual steps in auctions for \u20ac500 a pop.\n\nIt is currently in the design collection of MOMA.\n\nDrawing by Tomas Tvarijonas\n7501\u200a\u00d7\u200a7501 px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSzohMQA8phmFk9BJJSGUjbDHcdSf3v5sv85eMQLL22GF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUJ45A9ZszD4U5vyhiZiz1KDozkHTtbETSBbm8VDV27JS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSzohMQA8phmFk9BJJSGUjbDHcdSf3v5sv85eMQLL22GF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1agdKkU8dhnJ9rVEGZrfV7oNeAELokcdSb"], "tags": ["architecture", "design", "drawing", "linedrawing", "monochrome", "sketch", "drafting", "isometric", "axonometric", "illustration", "tallon", "stair", "moma"], "extra": {}}

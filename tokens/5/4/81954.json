Following intuition, geometric shapes, light and color, dramatic effects and overpainting, the result is nothing technical. It is a mystery filled with unanswered questions, dazzling colors and hidden motifs. A subtle infinity is implied and one wonders... where does it come from? A riddle for you, and you alone, to uncover.","tags":["illustration","digitalpainting","mystery","riddle","rhombus","magic","colorful","2dart","artwork","purple","neon","hair","girl","subconsciousmind","light","color","intuition","dazzling","dramatic","blue"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmYtBKtiWodziddLfF6x4LgAPN3uMR5xwEYY4GgVKNhGan"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYtBKtiWodziddLfF6x4LgAPN3uMR5xwEYY4GgVKNhGan","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

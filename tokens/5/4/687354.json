{"__version": 1, "token_id": 687354, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Brahma", "description": "Brahma is referred to as \"The Creator\" within the Trimurti, the triple deity of supreme divinity that includes Vishnu, and Shiva. He is also referred to as Svayambhu and is associated with creation, knowledge and Vedas. Brahma is prominently mentioned in creation legends, though there are many varying versions. In some Puranas, he created himself in a golden egg known as Hiranyagarbha.\n\nAccording to Vaishnava accounts of creation, Brahma was born in a lotus, emerging from the navel of Vishnu. The Shaivism sects believe that he is born from Shiva or his aspects, while the goddess centric Shaktism states that Devi created the universe, including Brahma.\n\nBrahma is commonly depicted as a red or golden complexioned bearded man, with four heads and hands. His four heads represent the four Vedas and are pointed to the four cardinal directions. He is seated on a lotus. Goddess Saraswati is generally mentioned as Brahma's wife and she represents his creative energy (shakti) as well as the knowledge which he possesses. According to the scriptures, Brahma created his children from his mind and thus, they were referred to as Manasputra.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmagzf12GMfvZmEZvttjbUeyCKK3m8D1inebCP1Tvmya82", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfMgCAENVjBvXfWXNrH2PkVAZPJ79kKRBNPLZDWYmse7e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmagzf12GMfvZmEZvttjbUeyCKK3m8D1inebCP1Tvmya82", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1W6MhBLazYS4ALwQJeJzqvfuJfRLEtoHm8"], "tags": ["god", "gods", "hindu", "hindudeities", "hindi", "Brahma", "shiva", "vishnu", "nft", "nftcommunity", "nftart", "nfts"], "extra": {}}

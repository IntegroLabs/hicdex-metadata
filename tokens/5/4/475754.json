In the story, she is the daughter of King Drupada and Persati of the Panchala Kingdom. In the Mahabharata, Adiparwa and Udyogaparwa, it is explained that she is the reincarnation of a Kasi princess named Amba, who died with a vengeful heart against Bhishma, the prince of the Kuru dynasty. Then Amba was reborn as the daughter of Drupada. But because of the word of the gods, he was raised as a man. Another version tells that he exchanged sex with a yaksa (a supernatural being).\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcpfjAhoQGaqTtSw1cFv7L4zT5wN5VYE4r8CFL7kU2Mb3", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc3VEyMKrqBQNhxGsfagjeSW4wsTkWjk3yM37gArg3V3k", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcpfjAhoQGaqTtSw1cFv7L4zT5wN5VYE4r8CFL7kU2Mb3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cyNKWVMv8MdadLpWEWvijqZXSWYrcXWDZ"], "tags": ["Illustration", "Painting", "traditionalculture", "collections", ""], "extra": {}}

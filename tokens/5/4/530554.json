{"__version": 1, "token_id": 530554, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "UNFOLDINGS - Subcube Transform 01 / DARK", "description": "Transformation between a series of lattices derived from a subdivided cube lattice. Lattice is transformed by adding and removing links between nodes at similar distances from each other in sequence. Simulation is based on Fruchterman and Reingold's method for force-directed placement of nodes which includes both attraction (between nodes connected with edges) as well as repulsion (between all nodes). This piece was produced as an experiment in computational design research on lattice algebras.\n\n@lukapiskorec, mp4, 1000 x 1000 pix, 1000 frames", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRqSXYuJKowNsbSDM6x1R5JnjHhEeWLCEW9dW6JZkpHwG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdoNLgbFaZYfjBjAVhyFS17PW44CY7CjZ3YZWu9qb5noc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRqSXYuJKowNsbSDM6x1R5JnjHhEeWLCEW9dW6JZkpHwG", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Lkgy2gYECvVK55yyiwjbSSZeUoQp8Azxo"], "tags": ["lattice", "sculpture", "procedural", "generative", "algorithmic", "computational", "animation", "3D", "structure", "organic", "crystal", "geometric", "abstract", "architectural", "design", "graph", "matrix", "algebra", "unfoldings", "unfoldingsdark"], "extra": {}}

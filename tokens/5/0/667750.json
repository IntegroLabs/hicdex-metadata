{"__version": 1, "token_id": 667750, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "EXTRAORDINARY", "description": "The thing about when something is EXTRAORDINARY, it immediately puts perspective on what is now just ordinary and the lauded extraordinary. It rightly and/or wrongly places more emphasis on the things that make the extraordinary beyond the ordinary. As we see in our divergent word zipper image, the moment we acknowledge something as extraordinary, it creates a schism to those thing that were once just themselves...now into two groups: the ordinary and the extraordinary. As the words separate from each other, the distance and meaning increases between the ordinary and the extraordinary. Once we have this precedent made, it can never go back unless those things that are deemed extraordinary become ordinary. Then the possibility arises to repeat the process once something is deemed extraordinary again.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmduvJ6xXDAQikXwnqLv22Q7KpmNZDoJhxN12jHMnBPj3r", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYs2eccWwML6vZCBBtyAkTXoHrtbyuoAL6iejoW3UR3GT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmduvJ6xXDAQikXwnqLv22Q7KpmNZDoJhxN12jHMnBPj3r", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

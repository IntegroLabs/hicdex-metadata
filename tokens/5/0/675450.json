I have been adoring his detailed hand-drawn scenes ever since I started my journey in NFT. \n\nThis artwork features some of my signatures characters along side the elephant that Guil loves to draw most of the time. This scene depicts a fun and happy time when we disconnect from our day routines. It\u2019s also a reminder for us to nourish our creative mind by taking a break once in a while.\n\nP.S. Guil is currently suffering a burn out and slowing down a bit in NFT space. Really hope that he finds peace and balance he needed in real life and come back fresher than ever.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeqkgXs5qXbbBGbLdiQttBgG3iC9imUwo4CUJtsZSzbvs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPnmwfYEzvxDYhT25g3ek5oQbgxUyoBLAP3mWswr4A1aA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeqkgXs5qXbbBGbLdiQttBgG3iC9imUwo4CUJtsZSzbvs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PdGThHGV3Dj96b7nkeJ6KxPf8x9sZjyP9"], "tags": ["#ELE4ELEFANTS", "illustration", "2Dillustration", "colorful", "animals", "pepe", "elephant", "blackcat"], "extra": {}}

She sang so sweet but didnt make any money because she put her patrons to sleep and they didnt find it funny. She used the powers she was born with to try to see the future that lay before her. It was torture pure torure and now the memories of her past continually haunt her. She has a Magigkyu Sharingan now to make up some mischief to make magic tricks! She drowns at the bottom of empty bottles and Tokes away until her sadness she swallows.","tags":["Tokemon","Pokemon","Illustration","Drawing","Painting","Anime","Gamerart","Stonerart","Trippy"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmQCNaJYFMHhixAZ2osn22fkknMdc32dskCm5FkSi8aNqx"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQCNaJYFMHhixAZ2osn22fkknMdc32dskCm5FkSi8aNqx","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdQL2ExBqpHp8oArtrZTzqTXEBrzeN4Kj2KxkCVk3WoB2","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

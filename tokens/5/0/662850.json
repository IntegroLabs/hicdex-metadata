In my productions I am interested in exploring autobiographical aspects of the migratory experience.\u00a0\n\nMigrating entails saying goodbye to a part of one's own history that becomes more porous and fragile with the passage of time.\nI try to reconstruct it through drawing, I let the line evoke separations, photographs of my childhood, bodies that become landscape, mythical and nostalgic beings.\u00a0\n\nThis series is a draft of images to name the distance.\u00a0 Dedicated to those who make nomadism and permanent search a home.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmboLCNfmmdewL7YmtRT9KAcsidyq5vfXaEsk8EX1ffJPd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXwzFRKLh9fMHYNpqbfLBWziafu355qAMe8tZnCY5wrMj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmboLCNfmmdewL7YmtRT9KAcsidyq5vfXaEsk8EX1ffJPd", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz29XmHYcAvXUq4Ae3ojfmQBx8EDhWs9Ptka"], "tags": ["illustration", "migrant", "drawing", "nostalgia", "grandma"], "extra": {}}

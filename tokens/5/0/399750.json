When enough successive pulses are received, the neuron sends out a wave of signals through its network.\n\nThe scene is different every time the app loads. The network is created by connecting the nodes generated by a poisson disc sampling algorithm. The network grows outwards from the cell in the center. Every part of the network connects back to the center. The graphics are rendered using HTML and JavaScript - no external libraries were used. \n\nBy clicking on the network, more pulses can be created.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWwiWmgxQVtP7jrsnQAGaLG3P4qPhcxXPiG1Ea7C2aoZp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS2dctBGpFH2PwKLSmqEneXgGrGMRW6BZY21RsWHcFMbG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWwiWmgxQVtP7jrsnQAGaLG3P4qPhcxXPiG1Ea7C2aoZp", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1LqqBVNDznxrxnoTKZ2akey971CoKqMJyR"], "tags": ["jobtalle", "procedural", "animated", "canvas", "html", "interactive", "neuron", "neural", "dendrite", "pulses", "javascript"], "extra": {}}

This is unusual. Most other birds will raise their young as a pair for one season, but move on to new mates the next. What's more, many species also engage in \"extra-pair mating\" â€“ \"adultery\" to you and me. Ducks are particularly keen on such additional copulations. By finding extra mates in these ways, each bird can produce more offspring.","tags":["swannft"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmPWauKEUnCeZn25dXGphoUNwxSe4cMdf4UQ4VpoQBC7u9"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPWauKEUnCeZn25dXGphoUNwxSe4cMdf4UQ4VpoQBC7u9","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

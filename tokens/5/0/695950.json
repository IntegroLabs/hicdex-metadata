{"__version": 1, "token_id": 695950, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Early Thoughts \u2013 Economic designs for an NFT based club", "description": "The precursor to the architecture. A product owner\u2019s vision. Here, I draw inspiration from condos by the beach. The ownership model for having an asset which is inherently enjoyable to use, but also an asset you may monetize as your permanent stake appreciates. Akin to owning a condo by the beach and having the autonomy to use it, rent it out, or sell it as you see fit. More economic thought, structures, and revenue streams underly this, but this is a general sense of where I am going. The owner of the NFT will own a specific piece of the club in addition to entry (e.g. table, seat, room, barstool) and will receive/buy/trade/be dropped tokens (e.g drinks, tips\u2026) which may be used or traded or saved or sold (but be careful about hording \u2013 some tokens have an automatic burn date). Unused capacity may be sold, with royalties flowing through the value stream. This should be paired with the concept of an inclusive UI for different types of people - investors and users. Lease your spot for the night and you get a portion of the lessors spend, as does the club\u2026 or just come and have a good time. Set your NFT to generate passive income or be really involved in the economics. It\u2019s up to you, the owner. \nAsk me more: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-aw-ehrlich-mba/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQRZ5SXQNYZBK5WJCYkwnemySxirBcyktnnai938pLeLd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaHGgmBUtdPPmTyKhQT9ttJTDBtJmQsJJYuW1URbNd99C", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQRZ5SXQNYZBK5WJCYkwnemySxirBcyktnnai938pLeLd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1V7uUHmeVQwWgqXQ1h4myofdrE5aZ3Fo1w"], "tags": ["Futureoffun", "economiesoffun", "ideas", "economicsofthefuture", "party"], "extra": {}}

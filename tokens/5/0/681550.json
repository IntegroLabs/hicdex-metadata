The moments before you breathe in are special. They can last a second or many years. You may have been told something emotionally important, bad or good, or maybe negative and dragging thoughts like oil have been holding you in their grip and blocking your lungs for a long time.

Perhaps the most important thing is that sooner or later we will finally be able to breathe again.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXV952TRFjxoMcZRCmiHaEaEtCYhuwQxzoRvEJkm6SXJS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNotvYUU9CV7RmYs4quBRsNZHa7hmvb4je2htNHz4PWvp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmewNYSbpQaXtbbnCwUQtyv56XhR2wUn4euYHEcjLsyF1q", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXV952TRFjxoMcZRCmiHaEaEtCYhuwQxzoRvEJkm6SXJS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YM4Rth44rBF2yXMZJJX8wo1KcShwwEpnk"], "tags": ["painting", "graphicsart", "graphics", "painting", "traditional", "illustration"], "extra": {}}

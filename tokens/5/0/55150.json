In the song I sample a voice note I recorded of myself yelling “I Don’t Care About Shit That I Can’t Stay In Control Of” during an anxiety attack in 2019. After sharing the song with Tara at the beginning of 2020, she sent me this animatic as a lyric video pitch and we went with it. Care about the things you can control and don’t stress about what you cannot.","tags":["heno","datb","music","moves","yosefgebre"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmWzEp4piNYqt6rCVbeA6jghhW6S9HgSr7h3ZAJrmXh3VR"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWzEp4piNYqt6rCVbeA6jghhW6S9HgSr7h3ZAJrmXh3VR","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

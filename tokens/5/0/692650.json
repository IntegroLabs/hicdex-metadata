{"__version": 1, "token_id": 692650, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Coloured Plate Five", "description": "This extraordinary illustration was produced in 1745 by Gautier D'Agoty, and form a remarkably detailed atlas of the head, neck, and shoulder areas of the human body, with explanatory text in French. The scenes were based on cadavers dissected by Joseph Duverney and made using the mezzotint method (from the Italian \u201cmezza tina\u201d or \u201chalf tone\u201d). Mezzotints are produced by rocking a toothed tool over a metal plate to create tiny holes that hold ink. The roughened surface is then polished to varying degrees of smoothness, thus reducing ink-holding capacity and creating subtly darker and lighter tones. Coloured mezzotinting was invented in 1719 by Gautier D\u2019Agoty's master, Jaques Christophe Le Blon, and involves making three separate impressions (of blue, yellow, and red ink). Since the mezzotint technique is quite labor-intensive, it had largely fallen out of favour by the twentieth century.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNSwiQKDoqpF3Z8rxDy88Kk1TVEHc6NrggRLmHmxy9uGN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW8SuY7uUzAwyh495QmiNtCx1yqongjyKdHYAWYiE2cXR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNSwiQKDoqpF3Z8rxDy88Kk1TVEHc6NrggRLmHmxy9uGN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1adzTMECkqqrJR2dMpL3MN7pPP4TwkY3HJ"], "tags": ["art"], "extra": {}}

A study which explores the deconstruction of a traditional European fa√ßade such as the Duomo di Milano, intervened by multiple digital softwares. My inspiration and narrative has been industrial techno music as well as re-imagining lighting design which is represented in this piece as lighting beams on top of the building. The intention behind this moving image is to imagine a glitch in our reality.","tags":["architecture","photography","backandwhite","monochrome","lightingdesign","techno","digitalart","newmedia","mediaart","mixedmedia","video",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://Qme1GaAEbmK92j9NZayp3W8YZyKHm2bkGbvXupvM3QPKHX"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qme1GaAEbmK92j9NZayp3W8YZyKHm2bkGbvXupvM3QPKHX","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

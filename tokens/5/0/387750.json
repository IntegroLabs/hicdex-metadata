The choice was the simplest for them to make.\nIn this moment they were undying and blessed.\nThe golden gates sealed firmly behind all those who entered.\nFear was a fallacy and it belonged in them no more.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSDvtduPxzM9KWno9WKWqxZqtJ6qFXu9oyMtt7gDg8otW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNWqqG1HU2Vgm9uXPWR7nygMEu1RzRMTmEsdMFTeirECz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSDvtduPxzM9KWno9WKWqxZqtJ6qFXu9oyMtt7gDg8otW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UXPeDzfhtXfSFT796Zby3VKWfmTC5pavU"], "tags": ["Words", "prose", "story", "ai", "vqgan", "vqgan+clip"], "extra": {}}

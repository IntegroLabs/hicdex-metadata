I figured I would let you know exactly what it actually is however. This piece is layered in order a thunderstorm, a horizontal river flowing backwards flipped and mirrored, an aerial shot of a island and ocean side cliffs, a praying mantis and a modern city. Elements are layered with different degrees of overlay and color filters some are glitched other a silhouette. They are then cut and layered and animated. Till you see this. Most everything I make is made in the same kind of fashion and nothing is really ever what it appears to be.

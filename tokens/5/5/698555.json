On October 12, 1978, Spungen's body was found under the sink in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel Chelsea. She had suffered a single fatal stab wound to the abdomen. It was long rumored that Vicious owned the knife that inflicted the injury, hunting knife that he had obtained after seeing Dee Dee Ramone give one to the Dead Boys' Stiv Bators, but the police report notes that the knife is a Jaguar Wilderness K-11 with a five-inch (13 cm) blade.\nVicious was immediately arrested and charged with second-degree murder. He pleaded not guilty and was released on bail, though he shared conflicting stories of the night Spungen died.Four months after her death, Vicious died of a heroin overdose before the trial could take place and the New York City Police Department closed the case.\nSpungen was buried in the King David Memorial Park in Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania.[21]\nAftermath", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd4QwsGv48cvFmZ1HWW9nXVHxymE2Yrmm1LfSyYvwGozA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWcP4zHpxrYjeArJPdNSc3w4Ks2UZfGQCq7Szu4HR9ZWs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd4QwsGv48cvFmZ1HWW9nXVHxymE2Yrmm1LfSyYvwGozA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UmKpDQzDHhC8m4H5z6GtWceQLBsqxpYrc"], "tags": ["Sid&Nancy", "sidvicious", "NancyLauraSpungen", "2022", "1977", "punk", "sexpistols"], "extra": {}}

In an attempt to escape from here, my endless and meaningless race began. Everything rushed past me with great speed, but I seemed to be standing still. And I feel HER look. He pierced me with cold and infinity, squeezing me from the inside. At that moment, for some reason, the truth of understanding life came to me. I realized that if the nail falls out, the horseshoe will break. The horseshoe will break - the horse will fall. If the horse falls, the rider will die. Everything is like in human life, isn't it? Take care of the horseshoes of your life.","tags":["HELL","PARADISE","PURGATORY","MOON","SOUL","HORSE","WHITE","BLACK","DEATH","LIFE","GRASS"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmS7hDd8j2WtRgETJNMeJW3PCV4syJKbh8TqivwP7VxWBT"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmS7hDd8j2WtRgETJNMeJW3PCV4syJKbh8TqivwP7VxWBT","display_uri":"ipfs://QmS7hDd8j2WtRgETJNMeJW3PCV4syJKbh8TqivwP7VxWBT","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

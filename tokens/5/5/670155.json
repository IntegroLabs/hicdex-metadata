It will be a transition of the series from a silent frame of images to a nostalgic video, with a generative sound, that will give you an experience to watch an image like you're traveling to a memory from the past.\n\nThe base of the sound that you hear from this piece was made using a tool created by an artist and programmer, Olivia Jack. The tool analyses the image information to which then translates it to various note that creates the sound. Then I used the generated sound as the base and added few effects such as reverb.\n\n\"Framed Street Irregulars\" is an experimental series by LEMSSS in which he uses algorithms and javascript code techniques to display his Black & White Street Photographs into a generative 1:1 video style of stills.\n\n----\n\n\u2014 Resolution 1500x1500\n\u2014 Format MP4\n\u2014 Images made with P5js and Native Javascript \n\u2014 Base sound made with PIXELSYNTH (Olivia Jack)\n\u2014 Duration: 60 seconds", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWe14fdRMxaTntoqVVjK2r7icPnBUTaQCC99yRaS4vVnP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcbkY5v82e4pf4sArvTY3FYVAwCT5Ny66XmdS4wSk2Tzm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWe14fdRMxaTntoqVVjK2r7icPnBUTaQCC99yRaS4vVnP", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PwrVxgqqcqJdPefNGN4ugHXKD4ebyP7y4"], "tags": ["mp4", "photography", "genart", "framedstreetirregulars", "generative", "street", "loop", "synthesizer"], "extra": {}}

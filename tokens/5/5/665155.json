Sigh...such a happy transition from flan and pies to life and death, right? Welcome to my seemingly random mind. (There's a rhythm to the madness, trust me.) When Lewis Carroll \"invented\" or \"discovered\" word ladders, I'm not sure he would have envisioned such a morbid realism to them. In his mind, they were just mind games, which they are, but they are more than that. Using the concept of opposites we again can emphasize the relationship between (in this case) ALIVE and DEATH with the space in between and how the words fill up that space. We're born, stuff happens in our lives and then we die. Those words in between represent the lives we live, the stuff that happens. The words themselves are meaningless, but the fact they use the space indirectly intimates this point.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPGtqxfLzayFRuVWJL1MDjBahjavbA1z6GxFXaevdmffw", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmbi82KVQosx2dPGzZf2csKvd8sRucNcfgYuLDmYZnnus4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPGtqxfLzayFRuVWJL1MDjBahjavbA1z6GxFXaevdmffw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

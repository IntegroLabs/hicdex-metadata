{"__version": 1, "token_id": 695255, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Baal", "description": "Baal (/\u02c8be\u026a\u0259l, \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0\u0259l/), or Ba\u02bdal, was a title and honorific meaning \"owner\", \"lord\" in the Northwest Semitic languages spoken in the Levant during antiquity. From its use among people, it came to be applied to gods.\n \nScholars previously associated the theonym with solar cults and with a variety of unrelated patron deities but inscriptions have shown that the name Ba'al was particularly associated with the storm and fertility god Hadad and his local manifestations.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible includes use of the term in reference to various Levantine deities, often with application towards Hadad, who was decried as a false god. That use was taken over into Christianity and Islam, sometimes under the form Beelzebub in demonology.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTLczBxhHMtgGTftv4RB6BC4mpwrFaXAZEMDpLG9TQSiT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbsKjQ3yQ7JhEARU3ArFLs4BNC7Ce78BGDcjqHc4XzT4b", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTLczBxhHMtgGTftv4RB6BC4mpwrFaXAZEMDpLG9TQSiT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Zrzs1sC9BHbRwtDgFrNC4fkZ5cXMw83ch"], "tags": ["codeart", "generativeart", "minimalart", "abstract", "mathart", "psychedelic", "minimal", "darkart", "angel", "devil"], "extra": {}}

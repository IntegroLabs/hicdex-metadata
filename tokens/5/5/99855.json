These particles are the unpredictable result of a low-resolution process of photogrammetry, a method that renders 3D models by overlapping photographs of objects. Foraging through the marginal residues of the softwareâ€™s digital processes, Mora dissected the digital landscapes. Wherever glitches surfaces, she meticulously isolated them, enlarged them, and brought them to life, creating a multitude of microorganisms-looking glitches that inhabit a similarly photogrammed landscape.","tags":["digital","worldbuilding","landscape","digitalresidues","fantasy","photogrammetry"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmcmxsKnozPUdNFzz2GoeosxtLpFZc35VsL4Mje92M4ZZv"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcmxsKnozPUdNFzz2GoeosxtLpFZc35VsL4Mje92M4ZZv","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTLxkkpf18LiTDvQacZBYEWfXSKsAp7QdPxxGDTFTeu3c","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

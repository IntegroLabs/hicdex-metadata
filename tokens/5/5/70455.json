The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","tags":["algoritm","art","random","generative","gif"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmRWfZ67z3zbSNTXbtSw7dHmQJSH1BYCexCFEArWY1MmUX"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRWfZ67z3zbSNTXbtSw7dHmQJSH1BYCexCFEArWY1MmUX","display_uri":"ipfs://QmeaGw9jYr8LvEh6s58vdQeKggqy2ByLcPsKfDAY7KSwHc","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","tags":["generative","wolfram","random","gif"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmZFDWYmNs2mg5oqMy15hAn7rBP6baJznAMKRD5KxVLFJU"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZFDWYmNs2mg5oqMy15hAn7rBP6baJznAMKRD5KxVLFJU","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZFDWYmNs2mg5oqMy15hAn7rBP6baJznAMKRD5KxVLFJU","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

I have lived with her since I was born; my parents are gone, my childhood is gone, my adolescence that lasted a short time too but she is still here with me. This poem arose from the terrible fear I felt of losing my grandma when the pandemic began. Fortunately I still have her alive and I have been able to read these verses to her.\nWith a poem I travel to the past. to my own memories: to my grandmother. Then she let me be carried away by longing and I filled her with color, with symbols, with love. Memories that are entangled with those verses dedicated to another grandmother. Beautiful souls who embraced us, beings full of stories and experiences and who were our sweetest consolation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTkhMMcZSf8bSwRMRwGPUPyfNmqw6SKWDnUtkVY4bcoFr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQrD9Xwzu6dFJcZbBjstg6zwrXV3eUF8it4QjWwwjhv1R", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTkhMMcZSf8bSwRMRwGPUPyfNmqw6SKWDnUtkVY4bcoFr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["KT1VVHvJRK8rQjXvEtj1KcNzgtuU9shkEmkn"], "tags": ["poetry", "poem", "digitalpainting", "art", "illustration"], "extra": {}}

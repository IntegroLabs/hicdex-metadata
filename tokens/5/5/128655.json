Button Batteries often get stuck in the oesophagus of small children and burn through the soft tissue causing fatal injuries. So many children succumb to button battery injuries every year! A lot of pain could be avoided just by being aware and taking small steps. Everyone with a child at home (or visiting) should do a button battery search and clean out to ensure your space is safe for the kids! Tell your family and friends to do it as well!

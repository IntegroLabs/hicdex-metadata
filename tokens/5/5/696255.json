The plant signifies beginnings, growth, eco friendliness, and the concept of nurturing what we love.\n\nStipinpixel is an architect who has been creating some very unique works on Tezos including the \"Street Moment\" series. In this work we see a green gardener tending to plants.\n\n\"Sometimes it\u2019s a form of expression, other times or maybe most of the time it\u2019s as a way to investigate, decode and be able to understand a little more about my environment, human relationships.\" - stipinpixel", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT85iDHrAYSziGWfXJ8R18b8JZfuiV9qQYPG2DjKxr3AU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT85iDHrAYSziGWfXJ8R18b8JZfuiV9qQYPG2DjKxr3AU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT85iDHrAYSziGWfXJ8R18b8JZfuiV9qQYPG2DjKxr3AU", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YEYsb7nCUZXvVmGe3KDUECc7TR8DE8QUd"], "tags": ["stipinpixel", "gather", "green", "pixel", "pixelart", "gif", "gatherart", "plant", "black", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}

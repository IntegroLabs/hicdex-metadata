{"__version": 1, "token_id": 691555, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "PAINT NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH.", "description": "I was just listening to the classic Marvin Gaye song, \"Aint No Mountain High Enough\", written by the legendary songwriting duo Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson and couldn't resist to make it a color pun by simply adding \"P\" to aint. Is \"PAINT NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH\" a simple color pun on the surface? Yes, but when we look deeper we discover a new meaning with the inclusion of the song's overall original meaning. In the song, the main theme is that no matter what obstacles in life present themselves to us that love will always bring us together. What's different in this work is that the relationship isn't with another person it is with Art itself. No matter what has happened in the past, what is presently happening, or what will happen in the future...I will always have art to play with my mind, hold my heart, and/or nourish my soul. There really isn't anything that could keep the two of us away from each other.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdnkBSWc3L6NP9oFinsmNLQETt6kXqVMcSDh3RqRRbefe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfRpWf9DqmXokB1dov7kiUSMmCWe773GdKqpXhQ9impH3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdnkBSWc3L6NP9oFinsmNLQETt6kXqVMcSDh3RqRRbefe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

This piece represents freedom the freedom you feel when you're on an adventure, your daily problems are gone and you suddenly experiment the state of flow, the notion of past and future disappears, you're in the now and nowhere else. Timeless because without time; past, present and future are one, the human evolution converges and all at once technology is just an illusion.\n\nThe movie Porco Rosso from Studio Ghibli was the inspiration for this piece, when you watch it all of a sudden you want to give it all and live in your amphibious airplane traveling the world with your own rules belonging to nowhere and experimenting nature in your own way.\n\nI was mesmerized from the scene of a graveyard of airplanes from all nations floating in the sky reflecting the results and the feelings of the first world War.\nThat was my inspiration. \n\nIn the middle of the canvas you can zoom in and find very faintly the airplane of Porco Rosso.\n\nAll aircrafts besides the Porco Rosso one were made with help of AI.\n\nDimensions: 4096x4096 Pixels\n\nTools used: GLIDE and photo editing programs", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXqmRqFBK3njjudtdBFVijFa3ZVuZrLmBYJkvuqdUE2bG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYW1b5QFZh8VHLDUcnfjLeevkgFn572Vf3tAjHFox13Ts", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXqmRqFBK3njjudtdBFVijFa3ZVuZrLmBYJkvuqdUE2bG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Wcx2cHwV6u3nyJ6xcVUDxNPeefDLPdbrW"], "tags": ["digital", "aircrafts", "AI", "time", "timeless", "universe", "evolution", "freedom"], "extra": {}}

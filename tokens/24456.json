I would leave my house during the first lockdown of 2020 with my old Sony cybershot camera and take some intentionally low res images of the place I’d been to. Every evening I'd create a digital hybrid as a snapshot of the day. This became my favourite place to go to, it was far enough out of town that it felt like a secret, like I only I could get there. Now, I’d like to pass it on to whoever needs it, a place away from the noise. An everyday place (#1).","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNzUUWL3m2t29M9EwYkmkgoTrgZtZWFvz4HjCui1C2wnK","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmNzUUWL3m2t29M9EwYkmkgoTrgZtZWFvz4HjCui1C2wnK"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmTFBYBn8w16b9vQST7aqN5zxMFb5LGt7XzHZm4wxEsQNL"},"supply":"5","transfered":5}

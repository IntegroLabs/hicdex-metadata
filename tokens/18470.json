This piece evolves when someone buys it. Buy it once and you will be added to the jellyfish list. Buy it twice and you will become a hammerhead shark. Buy it 3 or more times and you will be a killer (crypto-) whale!  This sketch uses some code snippets/hacks from @MAKIO135, @vamoss, @andrevenancio and @quasimondo.

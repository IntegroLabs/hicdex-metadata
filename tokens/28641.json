The art work is the result of intensive visits I paid in 2013 to the so-called darknet, the depths of the uncensored and anonymous Internet. I procured access to the networks where illegal goods are traded. A virtual space is shown that has developed beyond what the law permits and thus creates a parallel world, in which different power arrangements apply. A printed version was shown in different museums and art fairs around the world since 2015.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmavUUJcQHsTgEBgVYWEsNCjJgpKtV9VACnxcKfcHvqjCN","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmavUUJcQHsTgEBgVYWEsNCjJgpKtV9VACnxcKfcHvqjCN"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmT1yuETCjHrnPb63tHQs9eyop7SDZiRSHk7ac6rbLftAE"},"supply":"10","transfered":10}

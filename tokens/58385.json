And the bitter taste of plastic fades, when the morning comes.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmbk4RKx4LLkWAQM3Y9DDqKwwMFHCoJCBaAd8M9MUkjG2Y","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1YdELoZ1GTsqXAsQ9ycn9TaYNMNeovTDNJ"],"tags":["Digital","Illustration"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://Qmbk4RKx4LLkWAQM3Y9DDqKwwMFHCoJCBaAd8M9MUkjG2Y"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmRne4DqAju3Pebu2CXhcWyqVt9e2r9qVhkNu2y9tqUPcp"},"supply":"1","transfered":3}

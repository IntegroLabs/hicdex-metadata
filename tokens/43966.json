I hope that crypto art NFTs bring more beauty into the world. This work (00001) is the first I published on my journey into digital art starting around 2011, falling in love with possibilities of simulated media. The reference photograph was taken with an iPhone of all things. A lot of virtual watercolor, layering, hand painting and filters (including Filter Forge) went into this. 2592x1936, many details in image metadata.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSDCV87mtEVDj3cdALXqUo23DoYCEDTUt6oysPiyX9NSe","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1art8z8LXimWdV44CQiXCnMYk6EwFFZsyv"],"tags":["impressionist","field","mountain","earthday","corelpainter","filterforge","iphone","WorldArtDay2021"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/tiff","uri":"ipfs://QmSDCV87mtEVDj3cdALXqUo23DoYCEDTUt6oysPiyX9NSe"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmSYds6TwYLWWiRXy1wZL6TjDAjsfpEYYEjzjxSoWCtnU9"},"supply":"125","transfered":125}

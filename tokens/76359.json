The feeling of positive loneliness, empowerement, recharging, exploring myself, getting to know my own higher self, connecting to my core energy and transfering it to the visual space. This is the colors I feel and smell when I feel pain and transform it into art, to filter what's negative from space, and send it back to the Universe in a better, more pure form. SOLI is the power of light, pain, darkness and peace all together in one person.

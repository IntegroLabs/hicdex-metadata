For me, it's a doorway to a different reality and a way to appreciate the work of old masters. \"Time to Ride\" is from my series 'Modern Gods', a reboot of the classic piece 'The Birth of Venus' (1879) by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905). Also, there is a hidden surprise. Can you spot the drone?","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbXpxrkUQzxbvu6uXPnU4JzGnwa2F7jrYEVKeDC7wKetB","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1MQ2vg8GBuCYbwkHnie7GtPuYiTKZNQ1cg"],"tags":["baroque","classic","art","woman","painting","renaissance","motorcycle","motorcycles","gods","greek","mythology","diety","masters","symbol","herald","nudes","nautical","redhead"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmbXpxrkUQzxbvu6uXPnU4JzGnwa2F7jrYEVKeDC7wKetB"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://Qmf3EUsJkEbiHGDoB7pQQi1gRVzgWZKhF29SqXmvRAS714"},"supply":"3","transfered":5}

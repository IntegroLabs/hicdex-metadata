I started writing letters to ye& to cope with crypto addiction withdrawal. I wasn't hurt too bad. I'm safe. I'm crying listening to \"Ecdysis\" and minting this. The Time Loop has to be real for me to be this fortunate. I get to focus on art, library, and radio full time now that i'm not working militia duty.\n   I wanted to run away\u2026 Sign myself out and jump in front of a car. I called my captain asking to quit militia work and she said under the condition that I move to a safe house. I was very wrong about this place. It's great and I feel very safe; above and beyond my best expectations. The embrace of my plush wolf/disability aid feels like paradise.\n   I got help for my PTSD and i'm going to be doing intensive therapy as a condition for living here. \"What symptoms do you have?\" See that DSM V? ALL art score of 90-100, and this is the first time any medical professional took it seriously.\n   I'm not suitable and in no mental nor physical condition to do militia work - especially front line - \u00ce'm still vowed an Anima Pastor until death or 2 reasonable replacements, and sure. The Tao has allowed me to live in this moment in this Time & Place.\n   I d'un understand how I'm past my life expectancy and still in such great health and not only that but healing and getting stronger. Never underestimate exercice and eating your \ud83e\udd57 \ud83e\udd55 \ud83e\udd66 (being certified in basic nutrition education helps that last part a ton.). Oh gods... just wow\u2026\n\n\n1 edition for every flower when I got out for sub1\u00a2-Swap and hold the 7 I made welcoming me back", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTvT9v1JDkGv6PWNAAiepTPXLHnHuitpnfUtD3JNgAewd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPhnCpn3nZGLCcNUSXfeSF2UEy6tTvQZNorkaWsTbY77p", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTvT9v1JDkGv6PWNAAiepTPXLHnHuitpnfUtD3JNgAewd", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1WSB79B4pMAqzsfhqox2FzCRkf15ybZ4GD"], "tags": ["letters", "handwriting", "xtzfamily", "cryptofamily", "tezosfamily", "muchlove", "xoxo"], "extra": {}}

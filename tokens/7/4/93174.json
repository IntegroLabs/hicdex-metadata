The subjects are replaced with people of color and the inanimate objects are replaced with classic cameras. Golconda is a favorite of mine. It incorporates the Son Of Man model who was my photography mentor.","tags":["photography","magritte","reimagined","sonOfMan","surrealist","photo","fraternity","diversity","golconda","mentor"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmchM5CumpZNk6tUFxSqDLxjkoGHUeWW5xWYhFYZJG1M5h"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmchM5CumpZNk6tUFxSqDLxjkoGHUeWW5xWYhFYZJG1M5h","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

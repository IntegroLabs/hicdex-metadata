I am 2 years old with high functioning autism. This is one of my abstract paintings produced on procreate. I created this all on my own with no help at all.  I hope you find as much joy in my art as I have creating it. Collecting my work helps my parents make sure I get the support that I need and save for my future. I hope you like it and there's more to come!!","tags":["QUEST","PROCREATE","ABSTRACT","2YEARSOLD","AUTISM","NEURALDIVERGENT"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmcyN9dRDHLFaedoDnQQjjnLi7C4NMxfUKfrjtbcuVy5dr"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcyN9dRDHLFaedoDnQQjjnLi7C4NMxfUKfrjtbcuVy5dr","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

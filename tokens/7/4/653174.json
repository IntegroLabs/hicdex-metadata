Do what makes you happy, make art, make mistakes. Commit crimes if you want to. Do not listen to people that portray you as a criminal. Following the law doesn't make you a good person. Breaking the law doesn't make you a bad one.\n\n\"Youth\" is a motivational series for all the fucked up kids. It's about growing up and not fitting in people expectations.

Frontier life may have been harsh, but inside the Mission walls, missionaries and locals alike could find a peaceful respite, just as visitors can today.\n\nFounded by Spanish priests in 1776, Mission San Juan Capistrano was one of many Missions throughout California, that served as footholds for the Catholic church on the frontier, and set out to convert the native people to Christianity. Today, it's a popular tourist destination and heritage site, known for its beautiful gardens and well-preserved structures.\n\n#8 in the \"Inviting You Through\" series, a collection of windows, archways, and covered passages, which will invite you to look or travel through them, to see what's on the other side, or simply enjoy the journey of getting there.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmexsFJ5ZreZ5hufwkYdRbbq6rvMniC1AtWigz7JqD3iRN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmehqJAWiJmRNEzwABNfhPEqv1yFhHUwWhWDpweE2y2b7w", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmexsFJ5ZreZ5hufwkYdRbbq6rvMniC1AtWigz7JqD3iRN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz29ZRzr7Le6QHCpj3WwH67bEBZhfb1edpEo"], "tags": ["digital", "photography", "mission", "capistrano", "arcade", "cloister", "stone", "hallway", "california"], "extra": {}}

The Asmat tribe is known for its very distinctive traditional wood carvings. Some of the ornaments / motifs that are often used and become the main theme in the process of sculpting the statues carried out by the Asmat tribe are taking the theme of the ancestors of their tribe, which is commonly called mbis. But it doesn't stop there, often other ornaments / motifs are found that resemble boats or wuramon, which they believe are symbols of spirit boats that carry their ancestors in the realm of death. For the natives of the Asmat tribe, the art of wood carving is more of an embodiment of their way of performing rituals to commemorate the spirits of their ancestors.\n\nMP4 1080x1080 px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXnxdzPkuDrXyYXYrsbzn8GdADGoVRFCa6XkofBkZuBZd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcnunjcUwiVCdd9AeREZbkHApWsAExmrkp5hLk1LjRA3h", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXnxdzPkuDrXyYXYrsbzn8GdADGoVRFCa6XkofBkZuBZd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2W9u6UAPompBhXfeNBFEWNmCdhFRK9JJeA"], "tags": ["sint.marycultureofindonesiaasmatpapua"], "extra": {}}

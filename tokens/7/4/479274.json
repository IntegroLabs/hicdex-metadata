{"__version": 1, "token_id": 479274, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "\"Mansion on the Hill\" by Richard F. Yates (Holy Fool)", "description": "[Felt pen, liner pen, brush pen, and ballpoint pen on reclaimed cardboard with digital embellishments and color.] This image was the only salvageable picture from a bloody camera found at the base of Mint Hill (on the outskirts north of Henpeck.) The image shows the ruins of the abandoned Kessler Manor, considered by many citizens of Skuzzit County to be the most haunted building for a hundred miles in any direction. The \"spirits\" (as they're being called) visible in the image could possibly be interdimensional beings, according to Dr. Sheckler (Chair of Paranormal Studies at Henpeck U.) The few investigators who have survived attempts to enter the manor believe that there may be a portal somewhere in the building, though no one has been able to positively locate it. The owner (or \"former\" owner) of the camera that this image was retrieved from has yet to be identified. ---Richard F.

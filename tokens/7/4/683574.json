The bespoke NFT artworks have been created by Digital Craft People, a studio that gathers talented individuals to provide unique solutions across digital, from new media works of art to interactive multi-sensory experiences.\nThe concept for the World Trailer Awards trophy series is based on Perlin noise, a procedural generation algorithm invented by Ken Perlin while working on the original Tron movie in the early 1980s. The algorithm acts as an immutable blockchain, from which artworks are subsequently generated based on data specific to the winner, award and category.\n\nNFT details:\nMP4, 1080x1080, approx. 1 min. length\ncreated by digitalcraftpeople.com in 2022 for The World Trailer Awards", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRBoQQv8xkroLrsp3vamwruqBDECB7fzRSFua6N1dnXg2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTEGsg8ecFxZYGnS2hBqyYuyKSWcz6BE5V9ijtP6xpbVc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRBoQQv8xkroLrsp3vamwruqBDECB7fzRSFua6N1dnXg2", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1P3E6GC78iX6STz8C5ZZcAGmtSJhuh1u3k"], "tags": ["Award", "Theworldtrailerawards", "2022", "Perlinnoise"], "extra": {}}

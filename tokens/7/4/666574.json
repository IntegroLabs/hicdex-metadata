{"__version": 1, "token_id": 666574, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "TREE ROOT", "description": "Building on the successes of BEE HIVE, we continue to look toward nature for inspiration. Being that I constantly am in the woods and forests walking dogs everyday, it only seemed fair to represent the trees and systems of nature that embrace my presence. In TREE ROOT, we've created a word pyramid syntax crystal, but in a more literal way. We've tilted and structured the crystal into the shape of a tree and it's roots. This is definitely a new experiment within the established universe of these types of syntax crystals. It never ceases to amaze me on how many forms these can take or be made into. TREE ROOT minimally expresses both the tree and roots in one swoop. These crystals have long been word abstractions to larger ideas, etc., but now we're truly creating a different type of paradigm; abstracted representationalism. Words used to be the abstraction and now these same words are causing physical representation to occur. Truly a rare gem of syntax crystals.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXzG7HmM2sqPHk1cZdb8mCLoXPVTKUGYw8LRSPWjCKJBy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfH5QDvBYSvcTwBjQMp8yadv1zagsBATLcNVZS4JbmBpE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXzG7HmM2sqPHk1cZdb8mCLoXPVTKUGYw8LRSPWjCKJBy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

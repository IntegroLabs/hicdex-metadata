Within its walls, you will find many monsters living in a moving labyrinth. And on the sacred night when a full moon hangs high in the sky, they open the gates of the labyrinth, and bring forth, from the rich collections of the palace, a precious night-pearl, and place it in the middle of the courtyard for all to admire. Myriad groups of humans and beasts sing, dance and clown around to celebrate this radiant festival. The white horses they summon by their sorcery can travel thousands of miles.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWDWuqkQPmY2KcLqGzWAXdHNTqJTUpusSYsGiH8JWZFwU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZfQaAVF3QzAkfZ2RD8Vz4KoCt9VEViMhyNU8S7Y618a5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWDWuqkQPmY2KcLqGzWAXdHNTqJTUpusSYsGiH8JWZFwU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2QVmVnvivV9Rtne6imkv5qEJqC7oT2StPU"], "tags": ["Psychedelic", "watercolor", "surreal", "art", "vaporwave", "orientallegend"], "extra": {}}

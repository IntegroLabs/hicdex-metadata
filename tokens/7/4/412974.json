This image reflects different tones and shadows of light reflected on living stones and rain.\n\nThis collection is centered around a picturesque & sacred town in a Peru. The Inca culture had a unique relationship with rocks and stones: The Incas thought stones were alive and each one had a distinct personality. The streets photographed on a rainy night, portray the celebration of light and darkness, as Incas built these streets with their bare hands. At night, their spirits continue to walk through these streets.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWDcUdzyMGMLH6Rqt8hLfiU5ydCscvwKRpGoH1JJHvH6m", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme3JU8voUJMoEy1DRJSLJTU4WVDwpKAN56i4ZNGyXFNmJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWDcUdzyMGMLH6Rqt8hLfiU5ydCscvwKRpGoH1JJHvH6m", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dxNCjAaCDtzDEysEYr8ErzFwWoQVGB889"], "tags": ["nightstonesstreetdarkdigitalphotographyrain"], "extra": {}}

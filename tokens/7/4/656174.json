{"__version": 1, "token_id": 656174, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ONLY ONE WORD ", "description": "\"Only one Word\" is a collaborative work designed to protest against the advance of oil companies in Latin America. \nWe know that it is not from one day to the other and that we do not do everything perfect. But we questioned ourselves, we reflected and we realized that there is not only one way to do things. Beaches affected by oil spills take many years to be the same and it takes tons of resources to clean them up, many animals and plants die and some species become extinct.  \n\nAfter a good discussion we decided to donate all the funds from the sales to the organization RecuperoMiMar.com to collaborate with the environmental disaster caused by the oil spills in Peru.\nWe invite you to donate! Tomorrow it can be your sea or your forest. \nWe hope you like the artwork and invite you to think about it.\n...................................................\nARTISTS: @mentalnoise_e and @medus_art\nFOUNDATION: PROFONANPE \nhttps://juntospornaturaleza.profonanpe.org.pe/donations/recuperomimar/\nINSTAGRAM: @profonananpe", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbi5862Z6ex4jieahY7zc21KhUxszTmZSepynq8JqgF9R", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaW3DPmJtf8SnSgtV18uah6fciembS2JGPiwedqXvHsEd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbi5862Z6ex4jieahY7zc21KhUxszTmZSepynq8JqgF9R", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1CMXCcbntwtmpcaMXyPhzSosVB8PvRaVyu"], "tags": ["#nftcollectors", "#cleannft", "#nftcommunity", "#tezos"], "extra": {}}

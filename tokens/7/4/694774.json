Colossal Elephants could could live up to 350 years. They had humongous ears and those ears allowed them to hear all the stories of the world (and especially the messages of the fairies, which they knew how to listen to).\n\nListening to all these stories, they could interpret the future.  Their trumpeting could be hear across oceans, across continents and high up into mountains so they could send out warnings to anyone willing to listen.   Their massive bodies could move aside nearly anything to make clear paths to be followed by those in need.\n\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQXELLYZ6c7TZvk335GfYXtNmvA9JF4Pw3etGX69b331W", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZbfbgxEQy8DswVEkYSMasVs3bgZaEibYLbKaTTGD6FN9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQXELLYZ6c7TZvk335GfYXtNmvA9JF4Pw3etGX69b331W", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld", "elephant", "elephants", "myths"], "extra": {}}

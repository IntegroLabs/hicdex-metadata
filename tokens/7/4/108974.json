I've Been Bought Out By Disney. With  Amazon's purchase of MGM studios  all video media has been consolidated into 7 companies, Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney, AT&T Warner Media, NBC Universal and Viacom CBS, with Disney owning many of the major brands / franchises including Lucasfilm, Marvel, Pixar, ESPN, National Geographic, and Hulu. This type of consolidation is dangerous and will continue to homogenize everything.  Bring back independent studios, down with monopolies.","tags":["art","digitalart","digitalillustration","digital","glitch","glitchart","television","TV","colorpalette","colorpalettes","Disney"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmWqT4NCETvvXQskVxY3wRDPAV77abs8zowLTEPjcg7yXx"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWqT4NCETvvXQskVxY3wRDPAV77abs8zowLTEPjcg7yXx","display_uri":"ipfs://QmPu3AvMN6Wt3GKYXZJYPHFVguHPCZihpextqV665N4Ltp","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

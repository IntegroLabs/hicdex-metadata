This portrait is from Ho Ming Wang, an actress. She sat for my robots in Hong-Kong during the Human Study #1/ArtUnchained solo show at Artistree last November. This portrait is produced with a mixture of processes: neural net based image transform using a model train with masked sitters who sat for my robots in Dubai and Hong Kong. A generative system similar to the one controlling my robots' behaviours. @patricktresset","tags":["drawing","portrait","machinelearning","generative"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmQB8qGHP51u6hZB6CAEKaKLXugkmD427o5RyP5HYLdJio"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQB8qGHP51u6hZB6CAEKaKLXugkmD427o5RyP5HYLdJio","display_uri":"ipfs://QmefvPyUH34U7m8xxSSpxFaNnhTaw8qFtaQk4ee3DKTRwL","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

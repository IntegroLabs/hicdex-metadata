She wasn't sad or scared. She knew she is a strong and self-confident woman. Loneliness has always been her best friend, and this has actually made her stronger.    When she found herself alone in a crowd, as always, she started to think of a beautiful melody that she did not know where she remembered from.    The creator of this beautiful piece must have felt the sorrowful but yet peaceful side of loneliness.    Whilst she was listening to the melody, she remembered the fact that each individual is alone since the beginning of time.    And those who do not have the courage to face their loneliness have always found a way out!    She realized that she was not the only one who find themselves in solitude, that put a smile on her face and she carried on walking towards her house peacefully.    *Attribution for background music: Reaching Out Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/ ","tags":["Loneliness"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://Qma7KH2EPn1tuekCjhyGX53AkJ8TMJatcHpsSU4HeFptgr"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qma7KH2EPn1tuekCjhyGX53AkJ8TMJatcHpsSU4HeFptgr","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNTfFbB2g5gnNprLzVvAmmuLo412CucMLWueHeRh83Li2","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

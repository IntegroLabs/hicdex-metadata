The video and audio have different looping periods and they are not synced by any parameters. This is an experiment on the synesthesia of color and sound, part of a continuing audio-visual collaboration between Ali M. Demirel and Richie Hawtin. Collectors will receive a ProRes version of the loop for playback at various devices.

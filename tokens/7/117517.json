{"name": "the color of the sound # 060621", "description": "voltage controls the separation of colors between adjacent blocks. Higher voltage = more separation. voltage controls the alignment of block colors which is their rate of change. Higher voltage = more alignment and thus their color velocities will become the same. voltage controls the cohesion of block colors which is converging on a single color. Higher voltage = more cohesion and thus their colors will quickly become the same and Photron will look like one color.", "tags": ["Music", "Ambient", "Abstract", "Color", "Modular", "Noises", "Mutable", "VCV"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmVUee6Dg34uxCuhSgogAkw6CvMWDxRpqSuyfLHA6KYHe8", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmdNhEnQE1VrsxRxByfwQtujznmGAvisuUKokozpNsBdbb", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1TG9d5ACUTVsyASTP2yi412VbW8hf2HUV6"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVUee6Dg34uxCuhSgogAkw6CvMWDxRpqSuyfLHA6KYHe8", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

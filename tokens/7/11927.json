I create three dimensional forms and spaces in software, and then capture these scenes with virtual photographic equipment. By alternately hiding and revealing my subjects with soft focus and rich textures, I ask my viewers to be collaborators in the discovery of these non-existent forms. It is my hope that they will appear simultaneously familiar, and yet completely alien.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPHhaEq9JZ5c2MGuyXyinVG15XhHTcqxbNsn5Vcv3UpnK","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmPHhaEq9JZ5c2MGuyXyinVG15XhHTcqxbNsn5Vcv3UpnK"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmQfE51QRx7sWmXD34HJdc8AWcLfdoJtk9SgwDBiNnPUb6"},"supply":"3","transfered":1}

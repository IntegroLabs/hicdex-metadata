{"name": "Lost To Time", "description": "Located just outside of my hometown, this sign has been left to rust along with the hotel it welcomed visitors to. Back in the 1950s, this hotel regularly hosted visitors as they travelled along the highway, stopping at a variety of gas stations and hotels as part of their journey. As highways expanded in the area, tourist behaviour changed, and land hosting hotels were sold off to be redeveloped into housing. This sign will always be a reminder of the time.", "tags": ["photography", "hotel", "abandoned", "contrast", "landscape", "vertical", "colour", "1950s", "vintage", "antique", "commentary", "nighttime", "flash", "dark", ""], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmfWPwZdQ7317AbEHVnkSRbqufBhJiAJiDagTayTV8Kvtt", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmQG4j5evVXxiXLBYnpMWaHEk5ANUfUc9VY3Jd82GmZqoR", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1KrRdLubzd8EpZd3HcDHoFGJLe8ex2Fc6m"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfWPwZdQ7317AbEHVnkSRbqufBhJiAJiDagTayTV8Kvtt", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

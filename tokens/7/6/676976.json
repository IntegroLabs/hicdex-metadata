Crypto is here to stay and yet, it's intangible. How can something not only exist, but fundamentality change the way will live in the future and yet be as illusive as a snow leopard? THERE THREE ETHER shows us hiding in plane sight is how something can be and almost not be at the same exact time; a duality. Out of the ether comes the rise of crypto currencies, NFTs, and other new technologies that will usher in a new era of commerce. What most fail to perceive or anticipate is how rapid the change will be. In 2021, El Salvador became the first nation in the history of the world to switch their national currency to Bitcoin. Other nations will follow soon and the decentralized potential will be further validated. Within 5-10 years many countries could switch to digital currencies. From out of the ether to using Ether (is the crypto currency of Ethereum), the world is changing and it's time to pay attention.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUjkRQeqQsrico1nK3Tns97ioYvAgEgjneLcGGPrDXaZc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQxmGxidoi1RQjgBM9YzAaGmk2SFz74GRy4DSiUPU4t1n", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUjkRQeqQsrico1nK3Tns97ioYvAgEgjneLcGGPrDXaZc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

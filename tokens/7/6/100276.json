In the early 1960s, he performed as a stand-up comedian in Greenwich Village alongside Lenny Bruce, Elaine May, Mike Nichols, and Joan Rivers. There he developed a monologue style (rather than traditional jokes), and the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish.He released three comedy albums during the mid to late 1960s, earning a Grammy Award nomination for his 1964 comedy album entitled simply, Woody Allen.In 2004 Comedy Central ranked Allen fourth on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians, while a UK survey ranked Allen the third-greatest comedian.","tags":["ABSTRACT","GEOMETRIC","COLORFUL","TRIPPY","LOOP","ANIMATION","PSYCHEDELIC","OBJECT4OBJEKT","MOTION","EYEGASM","OCTAINE","GENERATIVE","NOISE","SHAHROKHHEIDARI","NFT","NFTS","NFTARTIST","GLITCHART","SHEED","GENERATIVE","CIRCLE","creativecoding","cleannft","cryptoart","particle","interactive","p5js","WOODYALLEN","WOODY","HUMOR","FILM","DIRECTOR","CINEMA","WOODYALLEN",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmW4Z1ovagGkvVFHDf2yCNueNNtNhR9QCRgEMKCUKb5axn"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmW4Z1ovagGkvVFHDf2yCNueNNtNhR9QCRgEMKCUKb5axn","display_uri":"ipfs://QmWrJVUVah9XwBCFkWWknrz6NxJpHNrPnqkHRfArX5iKs6","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

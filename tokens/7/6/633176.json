This work tries to simulate intermolecular forces in an abstract way.\n\nDrop Specs:\nThis drop includes 15 Unique Color variations for background color and particle colors.\nParticles have white color with a 10% chance and a rainbow effect with a chance of 5%\nIt also simulates the attraction between particles with random attraction magnitude.\nParticles can have directional tendencies with 20% chance. It has 8 different directions.\nParticles also have three movement speed categories that are slow, average and fast with equal chances.\nEach work has particle count between 90 to 150.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX3KeprZaatnVgA4G4aAfjsvstgpfuHsCooi2MVZWU1rD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRc9hqoYYJLmSydV1UrEXeisD9FwMG7xZwxV46g5w7KCo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX3KeprZaatnVgA4G4aAfjsvstgpfuHsCooi2MVZWU1rD", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1Li7PtjeLwwuHqLCEyyHGCTjNwCnFekSfE"], "tags": ["generative", "art", "points", "mathematical", "functional", "colorful", "line", "abstract", "post-modern", "random", "rare", "parametric"], "extra": {}}

She takes her food only from the left side of the plate. She paints her lips and powders only on the left side, and does not even touch the right side of her face. Sometimes we lose a part of ourselves to life's various circumstances, but we gain new selves.  \nEach of us is free to put his own meaning into his work, just as the viewer can put his own meaning into any art by any artist and give it his own meaning. This is one of the characteristics of art, it's versatility.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdjrYDn62UANoCmxfH3CysoCKVdKZHYtKzrVi373biKTR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZSFwuCJw5v86sjfs4nNyPifqyQDPCJmVT5T6376fSKuV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdjrYDn62UANoCmxfH3CysoCKVdKZHYtKzrVi373biKTR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1isi5RDuBMySNkQ6V63C1oZkEk8ds9rK5X"], "tags": ["rightside", "self-portrait", "photo", "shoot", "art-portrait", "art"], "extra": {}}

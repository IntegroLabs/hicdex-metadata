Each vase is rendered using a custom algorithm that generates 3D geometry, textures, and shading properties. This collaborative project combines a love of immateriality with the intention of admiring the particular differences of each model, as a unique individual lost amid the sheer presence of all the other individuals. The geometry and shading interact with the lighting differently in each iteration. Material differences produce new visual and tactile effects. The potential for the vases is endless As a result, while examining all of the possibilities of the latent space, the work becomes progressively more intriguing.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbXDheUgVTUiseQeS4z8ja5dGSf513KCc9D8vqpQLnZtZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQTefJW9Qgq94RdwvRwDPVhgdwxBsG1DgJUjRjutAkeFw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmSUTqbLQSKUWzcdTiTEhJADiUEmpLuzfs41ymbjec1jn5", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbXDheUgVTUiseQeS4z8ja5dGSf513KCc9D8vqpQLnZtZ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TLLmYpLiTERtJ2LzE1p8g6uX84dJbJwfF"], "tags": ["generative", "procedural", "digital", "abstract", "art"], "extra": {}}

They gathered together and sang hymns and psalms while burning the weapons the government forced them to use in a war with Turkey that took place at the time. This led to a mass repressions. Though doukhobors believe until today that the life is sacred and that killing others is against human nature. This work is commemoration of the event and experience my community faced, but it is also a work protesting the militarism today", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbWLnVyJxKBiafwRZXMBeuQrwPDnFdPNHC5A8ZoyrQZQh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNirdP7No1msac1KrAEv7WFRMEJBmyMv88iavXDb6hRNM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbWLnVyJxKBiafwRZXMBeuQrwPDnFdPNHC5A8ZoyrQZQh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L8RSMjxuEupFEscUk1UYJ9iFktojwvJTJ"], "tags": ["doukhobors", "burningofarms", "pacifism", "antimilitarism", "guns", "fire", "heaven", "prayer", "peace", "world", "love", "nonviolence"], "extra": {}}

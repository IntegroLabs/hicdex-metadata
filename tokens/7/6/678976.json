Hunting is the practice of pursuing, catching, or killing wild animals for food, recreation, commerce, or making use of their products. But now there is rampant hunting by irresponsible men who cause balance to be upset. If wild animals continue to be hunted by extinction, ecosystems are thrown out of balance due to the loss of one animal in one environment.\nBecause some of the above factors I urge all of you to stop hunting animals, but rather to hunt by NFT. Because hunting artworks at NFT in effect would make an artist feel good about his artwork in appreciation, and an advantage to the collector who gets artwork that could be an asset to them in the future..", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPkyZM9i7BeQsKGddVwi543FgBUbYqR3ZMKG5j3xGUdxT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPkyZM9i7BeQsKGddVwi543FgBUbYqR3ZMKG5j3xGUdxT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPkyZM9i7BeQsKGddVwi543FgBUbYqR3ZMKG5j3xGUdxT", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1hWHthtxQh6ddCucZBWf9oks8ezgERhZrA"], "tags": ["Painting", "artwork", "gif"], "extra": {}}

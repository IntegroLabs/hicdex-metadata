To develop these works I took a job in a flower store, in downtown Vancouver, to study what is sold on the global flower markets and how they are arranged.  What is popular in flower stores today is the result of a cultural and historical mashup of influences from around the world.  Still Life 8.0 is a contemporary wedding bouquet arrangement using flowers repurposed from previous paintings that sourced Golden Age masterpieces.","tags":["fizzpop","stilllife","digital","contemporary","painting","art","commercial","flowers"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmWCLHuFhA3qN8wFqnYghyWDNk25ixfULhCQzoswAatuNy"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWCLHuFhA3qN8wFqnYghyWDNk25ixfULhCQzoswAatuNy","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTFgsRuxdEBUby37oi3v9TmcXt2eBZHwHUP876KDwvjnq","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

The dragon would be shown in all its ferocious glory, steadily stepping as it sets the city ablaze. The painting would be full of intense chaos, the cityscape is in shambles, with smoke and fire rising from buildings and debris littering the streets.\n\nDimensions: 3072x4096 Pixels\n\nTools used: GLIDE, image editor, SwinIR, GPT3", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR2gvabHU74rkGmkMJV5ecpG9PvZkpKdB3MUwfRYhMbQA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcgapFh1zgRfQFwSsXGgm6NhdbyDWiLi8o51FcV3UgYV4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR2gvabHU74rkGmkMJV5ecpG9PvZkpKdB3MUwfRYhMbQA", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Wcx2cHwV6u3nyJ6xcVUDxNPeefDLPdbrW"], "tags": ["SadStatueofLiberty", "NFT", "art", "AILAB", "AI", "china", "fire", "burning", "chaos", "nyc"], "extra": {}}

Its extent is not known yet. We sent a robotic probe to explore the ground and search for life forms. The outcome of the mission was positive but no organic life forms were detected. The probe has explored the ground and under the rocky surface was found an additional liquid layer different from the one called \"sea\". The probe was called back to the surface. Recorded images are clear.

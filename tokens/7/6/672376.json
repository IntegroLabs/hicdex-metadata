I'm going to do something that I normally would think of as sappy and/or lame af, but I'm going to write a love letter to art; yes, directly to all of the visual arts. Thank you. Thank you for existing. Thank you to all of the artist that came before me, to those here and now, and all those that will be. Thank you specifically to Giotto, DaVinci, Michelangelo, Gentileschi, Vermeer, David, Goya, Van Gogh, Monet, Duchamp, Picasso, Fontana, Malevich, Dali, Warhol, Johns, Ruscha, Reinhardt, Christo & Jeanne-Claude, Long, Turrell, Flavin, Kawara, Krueger, Holzer, Sherman, Gonzalez-Torres, Hirst, Kosuth, Wool, Rosen and many, many, many more. Thank you to those who love my work. Thank you to those who don't know my work, yet. Thank you to those that hate my work, you know who you are. Thank you to my family for their love. Thank you to my life-partner Teddy, without you I'm nothing. Thank you to Art, I owe you everything. I make everything at the alter of your sacredness. Art is the history of us; the truth through the lens of subjective objects and thoughts.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQdythH1xJn8Wr7mjZxCR9nzeEDgCYPjw85VKGeCBGeYF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWnvcFkVs7BXNdkj5H6hu2GoVHxPkCs9TyyshjQxKJMAb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQdythH1xJn8Wr7mjZxCR9nzeEDgCYPjw85VKGeCBGeYF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

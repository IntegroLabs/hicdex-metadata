{"__version": 1, "token_id": 666576, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "TREE", "description": "I had so much fun making \"TREE ROOT\", that I felt compelled to immediately do a variant. In TREE, we have similarly recreated the tree from the pervious page, but this time we are only using the word TREE to create the entire tree, including the roots. We've mirrored the word pyramid and flipped it onto its side. I could have added other rows of \"E\"s to accentuate the tree shape (both leaves and roots), but decided not to as it wouldn't add any new information; the work would no longer be minimal; it would border on maximum. We never want to add information that is superfluous or garish; only essential. TREE keeps its integrity true similarly to the previous page's in that we've given a two dimensional group of words agency to claim itself as well as exclaim itself as the very same time.

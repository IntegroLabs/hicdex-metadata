{"__version": 1, "token_id": 642276, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "RELIVED / REVILED", "description": "In a parallel universe, where situations and scenarios might have been different, if we relived our lives would we be the same people? Have the same hopes, dreams, fears, loves, etc? Would be evil versions of ourselves? We all have the same capacity to build and destroy; as stated on a previous page, we all have \"limbs of construction and limbs of destruction\". We all choose to be good or bad to a certain extent or another...that is of course if you believe in free will, but that's a whole other conversation to have. If we truly RELIVED our lives would we be REVILED; a simple twist of fate or circumstance in our past could have sent some of us down a dark path of destruction. Conversely, in these other parallel universes these REVILED characters could be RELIVED as good people. The past is the past; the future unwritten. We only have right now and the focal point of reality is now.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSvFFYk2LoEMxqs7on5M25rzCT63T3ACo8wS97tVvyAsN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUjxm3SV8xvBu2L3rXo6CwPovLTubSf5iqiK5H3vzvR1p", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSvFFYk2LoEMxqs7on5M25rzCT63T3ACo8wS97tVvyAsN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

I’m in love with this painting, but annoyed with the subject, so I decided to add an AK-47 on the hand Jesus. So everything went in its place! The unglitched version was the side A of a card printed in 100 hand numbered copies and used in 2013 for a funny droplifting operation among Italy and Bosnia. In this version I added some false databending (direct image editing).","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRhRPuj6RRvncUfjrauKTEcZ4eR4K7sHBpJitbb7ayLLU","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1X2aQPB3C7RBNhfbGZQBPrJcvpy9Rhtg6t"],"tags":["Digital","Painting","Glitch","Databending"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmRhRPuj6RRvncUfjrauKTEcZ4eR4K7sHBpJitbb7ayLLU"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmSZF45BBcDfd15GNJgFocDgm5TY1ogj3KNJgv92eCRtBB"},"supply":"7","transfered":17}

We will slowly but surely make NFTs and CryptoCurrency one of the most polluting aspect of the internet. It's already way on its way to the top. We can stop that. Let go of old systems, use Proof of Stakes: either by jumping on blockchain that allows it, or enforce it on the leading blockchains.

We must do better.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPKaFo3we57Nq2ErWzrL3DYCrZ7A64Qt2Dfc7o1TDKxw3","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1fTZs8yQdVPzn56ygMmUTRmiLiLC8iFNtj"],"tags":["NFTsForAll","WorldArtDay2021"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmPKaFo3we57Nq2ErWzrL3DYCrZ7A64Qt2Dfc7o1TDKxw3"}],"supply":"500","transfered":1631}

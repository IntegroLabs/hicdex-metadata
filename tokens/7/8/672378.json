Freud said in 1933, \u201cthe ego can be split; it splits itself during a number of its functions \u2013 temporarily at least. Its parts can come together again afterward\u201d. Well, Freud, apparently you were wrong. It looks like your ego and you can be split by 5 totally random words: EGG/ERG/ERN/EON/YON. Who would have thought that part of behavioral psychology could be abstracted and simplified to just 7 words total. Obviously, this is an overreach at best and it would be pretentious of me to think that this could even be true. That being said, I always look for the loopholes in arguments and established thought. I could be right, I could be incredibly wrong. All I know is that our egos think that they're running the show, when in actuality, it's just a conscious fa\u00e7ade to our inner thoughts, wants, needs, and desires.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeVJfySUSsnCnxcaJU5yKH8nQzQ7DWY4dVgjRgod6iky2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTD5axXgpgCJJvJkh7cYKqNv6HqfLgmVQ6ovJWC3gdV6M", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeVJfySUSsnCnxcaJU5yKH8nQzQ7DWY4dVgjRgod6iky2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

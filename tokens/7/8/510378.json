Why, we get another BLG (Boomerang Letter Group) of course! PARKA VENUE becomes PARK A VENUE becomes PARK AVENUE and the letter can go back and forth between these words. The negative space between these words creates a type of asymmetry that's so soft and subtle. Almost as if saying to us, watch me play, watch me stray, and watch me slay. It's frozen and yet kinetic; an image of contradiction.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSZrePCWTPaJaVpSw5DZFNA2KNkGSRRGhnzv2EyWa9qS9", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd6dWxaaUCZgDX6LnVVG5TAmtmpoWmbHY4WTYbLnG4brw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSZrePCWTPaJaVpSw5DZFNA2KNkGSRRGhnzv2EyWa9qS9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

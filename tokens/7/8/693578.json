I am a self proclaimed Typography geek and something I am ALWAYS on the look for is movable type. When I was at The Portfolio Center the oldest print shop in the country named Hatch Show Print came to do a seminar and I fell in love with wood block type. From then on I've always wanted a press, the job cases and/or the actual letter blocks whether they're wood or metal. I've never been able to afford or locate a practical press but I did buy a bunch of random letters at an estate sale in Atlanta years ago, and just recently my sister was at a flea market and one of the vendors was selling small job cases full of various letters and what I would call dingbats. One of the largest and impressive blocks was this Ampersand which is a symbol that has always spoke to me because I am so often amped up about what might be next in life that I am constantly asking....AND, AND, AND. Not that I'm not content with the present, but I always find myself looking to the near future.

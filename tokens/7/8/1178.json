The link below links to a file that isn’t available on the IPFS network. Purchase the NFT to make it available. At that point, I will make the NFT file available on the IPFS network.   You will be able to verify that it is the correct image because the hash (QmYcLhMdcrvzE2LjuUb6r9zB8cwd2pRDbcKQvrsNC9Ha2s) is unique to that file only.  What is IPFS? IPFS or the InterPlanetary File System is a protocol that secures files to NFTs. When you retrieve the data, it is automatically rehashed on your computer to make sure that the data matches back up with the original CID they asked for. This process ensures the data that’s received is exactly what was asked for.  https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYcLhMdcrvzE2LjuUb6r9zB8cwd2pRDbcKQvrsNC9Ha2s","artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmf5Y4BSaAwKiax7Z681iJa9k2f1xbFB4eU65BaJ5GdAXu","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmf5Y4BSaAwKiax7Z681iJa9k2f1xbFB4eU65BaJ5GdAXu"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmYxU4RsssiMFr76Ew8ZtJRvKqtsGmoB9QkWnoVNbEr2hq"},"supply":"1","transfered":2}

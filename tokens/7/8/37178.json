Only weeks after they were revealed, the 5s were painted over and the renovations continued. ꗨ5 is a series inspired by transience and shared space. Each piece in this series depicts a painted 5 that briefly made the world more interesting. Each digital piece, in large format print resolution is an edition of 5.

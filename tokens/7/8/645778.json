This window through the trees invites you to come back down from the heights, and enjoy the French Canadian charm of one of my favorite cities in the world.\n\nThis particular vantage point can be found at the top of the Grand Staircase of Mont Royal, just before you enter the Belvedere Kondiaronk lookout plaza. You can see a portion of downtown Montr\u00e9al, and the Jacques Cartier Bridge crossing the St. Lawrence River beyond.\n\n#3 in the \"Inviting You Through\" series, a collection of windows and covered passages, which will invite you to look or travel through them, to see what's on the other side, or simply enjoy the journey of getting there.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeuWhjmFEtcS7QeA2otots3hXv7sk7rw6oBZYCkXnizmA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYBFeu5bMQi4g9sF433KoeEQE7wvPrnqhktVk82ZqqAdw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeuWhjmFEtcS7QeA2otots3hXv7sk7rw6oBZYCkXnizmA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz29ZRzr7Le6QHCpj3WwH67bEBZhfb1edpEo"], "tags": ["digital", "photography", "window", "trees", "mont", "royal", "montreal", "city", "canada"], "extra": {}}

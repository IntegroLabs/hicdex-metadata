Designed by the renowned architect Oswaldo de Matteo, they were modelled on Spanish farm houses known for their self-cooling properties. The 2, 3, 4 bedroom villas, each with its own plunge pool, were finally unveiled in the summer season of 2063 to great acclaim, winning awards for design and environmental neutrality. The use of cheap cladding and fibreglass resin in the construction of the Fincas\u2122 meant they became known for their terrible sound-proofing and poor ventilation. Nonetheless, they were a cult hit amongst architectural students, who still came to visit the ruins of the villas long after the closure of BeachLand in 2081.

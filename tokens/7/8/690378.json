This is the 7th piece in the Monochrome Designs \u2014 Purple. I wanted to do another Collage Creature that was made up of more organic components where as the previous designs have been fairly rigid and mechanical. Most people relate the Fleur De Lis to New Orleans but it is also the icon for the city of Lousiville, KY and I put this skull on a skateboard that I made for my wife when we met 15 years ago. Almost all of the images in this piece were from places or events that I went to with my wife: Atlanta Botanical Gardens, a wedding in French Lick Indiana, her favorite flowers are Tulips and I used to get them for her a few times a year (she asked me to stop spending money on them) and then many of the background patterns are floral or landscape pics from Hawaii and Charleston Sc. Purple is also one of her favorite colors and our daughters name is Violet...so maybe this piece is yet another shout out to my ladies!

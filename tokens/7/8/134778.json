The traveler dubbed this little rock, VX-02 as this is the second commodity of many, he's found orbiting our morning star.  Verbal Log Entry 23: I've come to discover an ancient landmark similar to those of an Earth civilization. The only difference here is that a pyramid upon VX-02 is still intact. This does seem to make sense as the structure experiences no weathering and therefore does not deteriorate the same as those of Earth's. The question I do ask myself is how. How did it get here? Why is it here? Why does it resemble the pyramids of ancient Egypt? As a flurry of questions fill my mind, I begin to wonder, what if I'm not alone on this rock. Who else could be out there?  I proceed to the pyramid to investigate for any anomalies. Alas, my reconnaissance was unsuccessful. Maybe it's time to hit the plasmid expanse, and pursue knowledge of my fears. What else is out there?","tags":["ENVIRONMENT","COLLECTIBLE","3D","NFT","LANDSCAPE","ART","BLENDER","VENUS","PLANET",""],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmXwwKzkD9HoTmA2jp4Z4WTbVzqyBnAKFMfKu8ADMvSatC","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXwwKzkD9HoTmA2jp4Z4WTbVzqyBnAKFMfKu8ADMvSatC","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZfAujWbjy5eztDQEaDojjVJ24JQhV9Hur354WUgmiN6S","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

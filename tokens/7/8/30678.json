I studied them extensively, but don't claim to understand them fully, yet. I use them often, rendered in a variety of ways. With 15 randomly chosen parameters, the random seed for this one is \"Poofokbot zinestnau nakdi\", by my pseudo nonsense generator. Rendered as SVG, displays crisp at any resolution.

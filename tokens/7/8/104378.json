The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","tags":["Random","Generative","Random","Cellula","Automata","Cyclic","Wolfram"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmWGF6RiKDV8cQt566WNzmnMr59dDowPaghXT2ESDibzXP"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWGF6RiKDV8cQt566WNzmnMr59dDowPaghXT2ESDibzXP","display_uri":"ipfs://QmWGF6RiKDV8cQt566WNzmnMr59dDowPaghXT2ESDibzXP","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

It plays with the notion of creator, tool and prior art.  The work further reflects  the paradigm shift in how we design objects of significance and authorship.  AireGAN creates a dialog via machine learning and the meticulous assembly of bootlegs, one of a kind sneakers and mass market brands- including couture and hype brands. The series further references qualities of readymade sneakers and their form factors reflect in the final works by reapproaching, redefining and reappropriating the readymade.

Please Stand By, For Special Military Operations. In a recent poll somewhere near 70% of the people in Russia said they approved of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, however it\u2019s currently unclear how much average Russians are aware of what exactly is going on. With Russia silencing all independent media, and enacting a \u201cfake news\u201d law with a sentence of up to 15 years in prison, Putin has been able to control the narrative of his invasion in Ukraine through state run news programs. In these programs his invasion of Ukraine is not framed as a war, but instead a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d meant to free oppressed Pro Russian Ukrainians. The only people who have access to real news are those who are tech savvy enough to use VPN\u2019s or find their news through the messaging app telegram, which accounts for a very small minority of the Russian population. In this way Putin has been able to drum up support of his unjust, illegal invasion of the free country of Ukraine.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYXimfPVwFWYw6SFrAWdmuhGYAiWHqsGG38nKe67rgQLK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRd4stGqQ4N6rh3GY7T5qPSwQW26S56Lcm4yJeJjBFKHg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYXimfPVwFWYw6SFrAWdmuhGYAiWHqsGG38nKe67rgQLK", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}

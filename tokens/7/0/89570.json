After seeing inequality, selfishness, greed and evil in the world... *I invite you to heaven, but you may not be very happy when you come. Howdy, i am Erhan. Pleasure to meet you, it is Angelina. She helps thousands of people and living beings every time she goes to the world, but she feels sorry for everyone she cannot help. What she sees hurts her deeply, she thinks silently for a long time without communicating. She's trying to find ways to help more living beings. The reason and the solution of all these things are actually human beings. Conscience is a flower that lives in people's souls and hearts. Please feed that flower and don't let it fade. *From the author: I dedicate this work to all humanity, but I especially gift it to sensitive souls who can empathize. I hope to share a world where goodness wins. Actually, I am not an optimistic person, but still, these are the things that go through my heart. Thank you for being patient with me. Forgive me for my english please. Best regards, Erhan. *Special thanks to Naoya Sakamata for this incredible \"Dissociation\" background music. *Attribution for background music: Dissociation by Naoya Sakamata | www.youtube.com/c/NaoyaSakamataPIANOmusicChannel/ Licensed under Creative Commons: Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/","tags":["Angel"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmRyS6wnHcuQXG3oA5kqrrpd3CemET5WDsw4TL1mpfZFj7"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRyS6wnHcuQXG3oA5kqrrpd3CemET5WDsw4TL1mpfZFj7","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

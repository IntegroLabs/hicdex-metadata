Throughout my life she's been through so much in hers, of which I will not mention out of respect. No matter what adversity she went through, she adapted and thrived. As we look at the image, there are two columns of words: one is justified to the right and the other justified to the left, yet both centered, representing no matter how she arranges her life, she's still centered. She continues to inspire me to look to women for sage advice. I honestly don't know where I'd be without the women in my life. Love you Aunt Sandy!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR4te1Jk5AGDBCUm1CivoMzpkXB9B95GHHsUkXCzswq8R", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmThXHQWpofmTLUhHGN6iDjV6CJzhZWZacXUmnRuEuciBG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR4te1Jk5AGDBCUm1CivoMzpkXB9B95GHHsUkXCzswq8R", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

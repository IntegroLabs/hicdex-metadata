Astronomers have long jokingly referred to the moon as the \u201cDeath Star\u201d due to its resemblance to the planet-sized battle station from Star Wars. The large impact crater \u2014 known as Odysseus \u2014 is actually one of the largest in the entire Solar System. Tethys is roughly 660 miles across and the crater is nearly 280 miles wide, meaning the crater itself represents 5 percent of the moon\u2019s total surface.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQjrqPaairv76jZRPSM7nxfkTHssx3tZ58pSmurAZFaHU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQjrqPaairv76jZRPSM7nxfkTHssx3tZ58pSmurAZFaHU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQjrqPaairv76jZRPSM7nxfkTHssx3tZ58pSmurAZFaHU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XdkwpPDRW2Lcn9TcmfDgmtDPysE7YQY4L"], "tags": ["space"], "extra": {}}

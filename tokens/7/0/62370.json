As usual, I was looking for a setup I would like and during this quest, I arrived at this stage which I like a lot. The composition is not too complex and specially the background gives it an antique touch. When writing down the title, I noticed that \"antique\" could be divided and then, in spanish, it means \"against what\". As this picture is not intended to be directed against anything, the title displays the question “Against what?”","tags":["glass","jewelry","pendant","antique","beauty","humour",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmUrqHjUjaRkgcUwSLqQwuVQx1mTGVKarYbSnjos2zefdg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUrqHjUjaRkgcUwSLqQwuVQx1mTGVKarYbSnjos2zefdg","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

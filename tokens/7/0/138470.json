Each piece in the series created by Graffito has a different starting point and then explodes to fill the screen with overlapping patterns and colours. The core of Graffito is a set of randomly generated curves connecting points along a straight line. Each point is then animated by a randomly assigned trajectory. As the points move, the curves that join them weave and interact, creating these unique generative patterns.  \u00a0 Presented here are 6 unique single-edition pieces generated by the Graffito algorithm.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcGyuVitjgmsUrTWYggBJxisAFsSTbWNdezSdGVmrh2Ea", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma5X8NiKAvxqKjWAyheWJEtP3b2U1RPL9wAWYzdUHmjzV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcGyuVitjgmsUrTWYggBJxisAFsSTbWNdezSdGVmrh2Ea", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RzomQhc8ttSFR7LgsaFxMpwVBCUpWqRYe"], "tags": ["AutoEclectus", "P5JS", "Generative", "Algorithm"], "extra": {}}

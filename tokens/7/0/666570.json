Though the words have changed, the structure has not. I'm usually forward thinking in terms of experimentation, but on this one I wanted a classic feel to it. SO I LIED has a few potential narrative connotations to it. 1. Why do we lie? Is it something innate in all of us? 2. What am I lying about? Am I projecting an insecurity about my own talent onto my artwork? 3. If yes, then why? If no, then what is the lie? 4. Is it better to tell the truth about lying or lie about the truth? Does this crystal hold the truth or is it full of lies? So many questions and the truth may never be known.

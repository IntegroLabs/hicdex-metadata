From the age that I still believe in hopes and dreams, the 7-year life cycle, to the age of dealing \"if I still have sleep and food for today.. that's enough\", until \"karma is the key\".\n\nAnd in between those times, I realized that it was \"VVolves\" that often kept me going, made me laugh, and even my steps were colored because of them. Although I know it's very ironic because these \"VVolves\" are from a life I regretted earlier.\n\n1800x1800px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfMXSdfx5kEPTj7HZwnTCadF5VaxRfXLCCiY7fsg2hvrK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfMXSdfx5kEPTj7HZwnTCadF5VaxRfXLCCiY7fsg2hvrK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfMXSdfx5kEPTj7HZwnTCadF5VaxRfXLCCiY7fsg2hvrK", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1N5W4bKhT78Vy18xgq9ZdsmdkGFxxTVd5T"], "tags": ["digitalart", "illustration", "yellovvjumpsuit", "character", "they're-vvolves", "doodle", "artwork", "animation"], "extra": {}}

This Ephemera shows the progressive exploration of the CRYPTOPLASM concept. It is made from a relic of WORKSITE I which took place in Villa Medici, in Rome, between the 4 and 7 of August 2018 at the closing of Take Me I’m Yours, curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Chiara Parisi and Chrisitan Boltanski. This 3D scanned brick and mortar is recomposed to build an autonomous architectural vocabulary that will be adopted to create complete AR or printed cryptoplasmic architectures. This NFT is registered in the Cryptoplasm Table of Elements.","tags":["cryptoplasm","ephemera","artificialmatter","architecturegenetics","nonfunctionalarchitecture","prearchitecture","cryptoplasmicarchitecture","alphabet","objkt4objkt"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/quicktime","uri":"ipfs://QmdARMe28cXJofVyrJUQjpSpeHMQd8YfKNhXrBxJy5Muhx"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdARMe28cXJofVyrJUQjpSpeHMQd8YfKNhXrBxJy5Muhx","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

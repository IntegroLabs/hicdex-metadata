Please Stand By, Calling Ghostbusters. This past Saturday, legendary director / producer Ivan Reitman died at the age of 75. Reitman best known for directing the surprise hit Ghostbusters, also had his hand in many other successful movies including National Lampoons Animal House, and Twins. But it was ultimately Ghostbusters that Reitman will always be remembered for. Ghostbusters played a pivotal role in my life, as well as the lives of many kids of my generation. Beyond being the first movie I remember seeing in a theatre, it was my first foray into a pop culture phenomenon that included multiple cartoon adaptations, comic books, collector toy lines and even video games. It\u2019s subtle mix of action, horror, and comedy brought together kids and adults and his character designs for both Stay Puft and Slimer have become iconic in pop culture lexicon. He will be sorely missed, but hopefully he died knowing he inspired an entire generation of kids, to be weird, creative and fun. Rest in Power Ivan Reitman.

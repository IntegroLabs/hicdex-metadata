Located just 2nm south of Paxos is a place where many Paxiots own land, a vineyard or a house. As an island the typical way to reach it is by boat. Paxos locals also many of them own boats and old fishing boats from their acestors. The traditional fishing boat of Greece is called \"Kaiki\". On the photograph we see a smol \"Kaiki\" trying to cross the Paxos-Antipaxos channel. On the top left corner we can see Antipaxos northern corner.

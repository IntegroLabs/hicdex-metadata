As I've said before I am a bit of a hoarder, and I have been saving shopping bags for probably 25 years now. Yeah it's an unusual thing to hold onto but as a designer I am not only fond of typography and photography, but I also just like the idea of a functional piece of advertising. The main image in todays design is of Paris Hilton from a GUESS shopping back from probably around 2003. I was about to write that companies like GUESS would have abandoned sexually explicit advertising in todays modern age, but I looked it up real quick and they are basically still using the same type of photography to sell their brand. It seems like sex will always sell and as long as there are models willing to dress down than no amount of public outcry is ever gonna change that.

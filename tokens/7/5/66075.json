It's a very small island close to Milos, but it has the most beautiful beach I've had the opportunity to see in Greece so far. It's also a very calm and authentic island. The milkyway was clearly visible every night after 10Pm, from our bear eyes. It draws in the sky of Kimolos like a map of stars guiding you back home from a long evening out, drinking, eating and watching movies at the open air theaters downtown.","tags":["Stars","space","scifi","sci-fi","space","milkyway","milky","way","photography","astrophotography","deep","sky","photo","NFT","art","glitch","glitches","abstract","dark","horror"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmUPW9iHCfrirqFpuUf2UFcPTb76dekM2RQ1Lk3d8TbdiC"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUPW9iHCfrirqFpuUf2UFcPTb76dekM2RQ1Lk3d8TbdiC","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

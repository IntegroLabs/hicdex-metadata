In that year, I explored many ideas about self portrait and tried to share something personal into my art. And this is my favorite one from self portrait series in 2010.\n\nFadhlil abdi", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeJ8KNCqgNKZFBGB3K8ssisivKNBPQztXQud9Uszazp5h", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTgci9MkTfdWr4s6hwL96RBQZUzVhUQ7F7KBTbCAFN5uF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeJ8KNCqgNKZFBGB3K8ssisivKNBPQztXQud9Uszazp5h", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz28borFEokESF2JVrEadGAWQA7oG8shrfUJ"], "tags": ["painting", "realist", "hyperrealist", "surealist"], "extra": {}}

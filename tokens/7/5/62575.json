For buyers, since H=N only allows 40MB, I can send the original files. Contact me: gustavohpaim@gmail.com. This is the fourth of my Droning Loop series, a repetitive chord feedback composition for electric bass. Low sounds move slower, resonate with bigger surfaces, hit us in the center of the body, displace the sovereignty of the head/brain as receptors of sound to the whole body. Low sounds invite us to a more patient immersion.","tags":["soundart","sound","music","noise","drone","feedback","tape","loop","contemporary","musique","concr√®te","musicnft","generative",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmbwScaPviooFtEfHaFdgELrg9nFvvAY8LLFMHbg5MawMc"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbwScaPviooFtEfHaFdgELrg9nFvvAY8LLFMHbg5MawMc","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

The equations that govern this are deterministic, yet the task is impossible, and small errors feed forward and lead to total unpredictability. IN THIS SKETCH we see an example of a seemingly stable system. A rare outcome, not unlike our closest galactic neighbor, Alpha Centauri. I don't know how long this system remains stable. My simulation does not yet have access to these timescales, but I'm working on it.","tags":["gif","animated","3bodyprob","physics","dither","pixelart"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmZ8MEemUhJ4idicB9rdQU9r615bRMxosBrBMa9SJUk6pT"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZ8MEemUhJ4idicB9rdQU9r615bRMxosBrBMa9SJUk6pT","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Or something like that...Swing low in your weep ship, with your tear scans and sob probes, and you would mark them. Women--and they can be wives, lovers, gaunt muses, fat nurses, obsessions, devourers, exes, nemeses--will wake and turn to these men and ask, with female need-to-know, 'What is it?' And the men will say, 'Nothing. No it isn't anything really. Just sad dreams.'","tags":["photoart","retrowave","neon","noir","night","photography","cyberpunk","postsoviet","ukraine","dark","colorful","street","citylights","streetlights","vibe","vibes","glow","purple","ambient","ambience","retrofuturism","nightphoto","photography","synthwave","vaporwave"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmTiHQXz6d9M9Pijg16pH8kdUTW8ac3JCUxgxc62BLDZPh"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTiHQXz6d9M9Pijg16pH8kdUTW8ac3JCUxgxc62BLDZPh","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTWi6M9tmxP6NqrsMcc4vwvsxJjsUVKdTut4rFFrcWBrk","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

  "description": "Commonly known as a click beetle due to the noise it makes when jumping, there are many species of click beetles that produce bioluminescence. These beetles rapidly contract their upper and lower body simultaneously to create kinetic energy enough to jump big heights, the impact between the two body parts doesn't harm the insect since it is chitin-based and extremely hard. Interactive tool for zooming in and appreciating micro landscapes. For full resolution image, contact @julioglatt 2021",

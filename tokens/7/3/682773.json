These are all contemporary (at the time of writing this) crypto currencies, with the exception of the last one HODL; I'll explain that one in a minute. DOGE/HOGE/HOGL are all independent of each other and yet are connected through the weird and wonderful world of word ladders. Being a crypto investor and an NFT artist blends together sometimes into a risky milkshake of peril and potential. (That's great Andrew, but what the heck is HODL then?) Great question reader! The word HODL started out as a misspelling of HOLD in reference to when Bitcoin was dropping fast back in 2018. It became a huge hit as a punchline. For awhile, everything was HODL this and HODL that. HODL memes were made. Clothing had the misspelling on it. It was the crypto zeitgeist for a time. The meaning has since been morphed as a acronym \"Hold on for dear life\u201d, which if you ask me sounds ok, but they conveniently leave off the \"F\" in the acronym; seems forced. Then again...some of the people reading this book will think half of what I do is forced...and they wouldn't be wrong per se. But I digress...", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmecHqHdM3b2KWj6Gq4XVprTpcyHqNTvwjbig3NeHAz76K", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma9rukvZCaWrbuD2DjLbJsXLvg8zsTq5Pt6FV1QT6SJgR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmecHqHdM3b2KWj6Gq4XVprTpcyHqNTvwjbig3NeHAz76K", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

Which is - I dare say- CRIMINAL, since it was such a fuckin\u2019 PERFECT album from start to finish. That fantastic cover, a close up shot of a boxer getting his lights punched the fuck out of him, is the most appropriate visual summary of the non-stop audio barrage contained within. This album held nothing back to absolutely SLAPPED the shit out of its listeners, with a deadly combo of peak-90\u2019s-Soul Assassins-production bodyslams and Everlast\u2019s heavy growl delivery ground-and-pound beatdowns, all while Danny Boy spouts his signature nonsense trash-talks and generally just doing Danny Boy things. \n\nExquisitely mixing its crisp and tight production while keeping it rough around the edges at the same time, \u201cSame as it Ever Was\u201d should definitely go down in history as one of the crown-jewels of 90\u2019s hip hop, and today -26 years later- it remain as hard as it ever was.  \n \nCard is made from Same as it Ever Was cover shot.\n\nFigure is made from repainted NECA\u2019s Rocky Series 2 figure.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVAYMYj1zoux9Zztziq2nLQyyHeqF3AJMcMCN6bjUStVo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQCN94npcpvrXwhnbmv8Hk4tk1LbQNC8sLQAFBLnMojxN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVAYMYj1zoux9Zztziq2nLQyyHeqF3AJMcMCN6bjUStVo", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aXpmExefGTPY8Zw8WtaLyKK7AzdsvbZw2"], "tags": ["Digital", "Collage", "HipHop", "Albumart"], "extra": {}}

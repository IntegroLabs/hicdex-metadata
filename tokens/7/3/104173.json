The combination is made up of 10 element types, each with up to 10 variants. The works of The Unknown Portraits Series are digital drawings or paintings in which the artist addresses the \"portraits“ in the digital age - it's about avatars and profile pictures, face recognition and the handling of personal rights in today's world. It's about simplification. And it's about uniqueness.

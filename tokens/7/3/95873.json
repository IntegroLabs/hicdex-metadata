Hunting has been the major cause of the decline of the dama gazelle, especially after motorized hunting with modern firearms began. Recently, the dama gazelle's habitat has become increasingly drier and less suitable, due to long-term climate change as well as to overgrazing by livestock and loss of tree cover due to clearing by man. Furthermore, the increasing presence of livestock has driven the gazelle away from the pastures where it formerly obtained both food and water.  Civil unrest in the area where it resides has also contributed to its decline.","tags":["Doodle","art","species","marccraig","environment","endangered"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmdJetVmFbtgDsEz3RvheUG9JVHrpfyjpev9b7tEYdYGgr"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdJetVmFbtgDsEz3RvheUG9JVHrpfyjpev9b7tEYdYGgr","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

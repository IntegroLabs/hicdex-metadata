No physical copy of this painting remains. It has been burnt. After several years of not painting, I took up the brush again only to burn the picture as soon as it had dried. I'm offering the painting as an NFT. Also included is an original composition, \"Burn Bossa\" inspired by the jazz standard, Blue Bossa.","tags":["watercolor","burnt","painting",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://Qme8SFmDuAFpYicNdp3SWjqvc2fXDWJzbiWEbzAvSuNeiy"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qme8SFmDuAFpYicNdp3SWjqvc2fXDWJzbiWEbzAvSuNeiy","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

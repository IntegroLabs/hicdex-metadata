This was probably the first time I ever made a \"scientific\" image purely for aesthetic reasons. I wanted it to be minimal, but also highlight the exact nature of the paper. If you are a protein X-ray crystallographer and you see this image, you probably see the issue right away... these atoms are not centered properly in their electron density clouds. Proteins are weird, and they don't follow our rules perfectly, no matter how convenient it is to pretend they do.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRuKip66PDYkbdKVXQrBBSCCd5g7JGCzmPQfQxUqvoi79", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaRAiLr8K3GMQzdLMdKQ1TiJwjcakYtQrmnYXgvbqMDV2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRuKip66PDYkbdKVXQrBBSCCd5g7JGCzmPQfQxUqvoi79", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZBMhTa7gxSpaeXoqyc6bTCrxEHfZYSpPt"], "tags": ["science", "protein", "sciart"], "extra": {}}

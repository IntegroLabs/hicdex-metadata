This specific weekend Toronto was hosting a mix of celebrities, athletes, and musicians for some of the biggest events. During a private afterparty I was approached by Lebron's Manager and told \"He doesn't normal let people take pictures of him, but he has asked if you could shoot a few for him\". The view down the lenses of my camera is one that I will never forget, it was almost as if I was face to face with a cardboard cut out, instead it was the legend himself. - Gabriel Di Sante","tags":["nba","nbastar","celebrities","toronto","torontophotographer","lebron","Lebronjames","lakers"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmfRnTfrWQEfgnFHNN4YVXqKgH24MQ7CjHKSwH3X9FK18K"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmfRnTfrWQEfgnFHNN4YVXqKgH24MQ7CjHKSwH3X9FK18K","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbBxBcwXx3dCeqeb7d6jSZagXo1kgeAcoYz14dCUDH3DH","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

People called him the undefeated ry\u016b (dragon) , a ry\u016b that no one can slay . Many kings ,rulers , swordsmans ,ninjas tried to defeat him but never succeeded . He was so powerful that he could take down an entire army with ease. Because of his such strength ,he was an independent samurai ,who served to no one .He was free as a bird or a ry\u016b . On one full moon night ,after eating his dinner . He was on a night walk , and heard a voice from the shadows , Kazan ry\u016b ,I am here to challenge you ,for a duel, Meet me at tsuyama castle . He never refused any challenge , and he knew it, that it is a ninja , because nobody is as Stealth as a ninja . He could sense his tremendous power emitting out of him . He accepted the challenge .                Scene 1: At tsuyama castle .                Kazan: You are powerful son ,I can sense it.                                      Ninja: well I will show you exactly how much .                           Kazan: hahaha , I was just like you at your age , eager to defeat everyone , become the most powerful.                Note:- a ninja who is famous is a failed ninja ,so we don't know anything about this young ninja . Not even his clan.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfB7EY9ZppMm1qpCsZ7dyHPxsnv6p7LWDd811w1R1Ys17", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRuBPDtqwCzcb3Ua2xQJuYvWoQSy7WwiTAT8EKmAT45vk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfB7EY9ZppMm1qpCsZ7dyHPxsnv6p7LWDd811w1R1Ys17", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TabUj5ot4nRc9po4j13XJx1rRLNco5pVh"], "tags": ["Photoshop", "Ninja", "Samurai", "Dragon", "Sword", "Japan"], "extra": {}}

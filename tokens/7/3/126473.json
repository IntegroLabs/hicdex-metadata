These are monochrome abstract landscapes influenced by the concept of “mind landscape” which is a cultivated landscape burgeoned in the time of the Yuan dynasty. In this classical Chinese tradition, abstract landscapes are created as a mirror of the artist’s heart and mind; and have no relation to the visible world. The generative landscapes are produced with the same concerns but with modern computational techniques; composed with randomness. The search is for a place where the mind stays away from the chaos of images and associations.","tags":["GENERATIVE","LANDSCAPE","CHINESE","NOISE"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmNpPpWPz6APfJT7Jy5avhGEseH6TQdviftNTP3kt1zkXS","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNpPpWPz6APfJT7Jy5avhGEseH6TQdviftNTP3kt1zkXS","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXvaJtHCZnWV6AwK3GwLpCrpkjfcT2P92bPWkZJf7osnW","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

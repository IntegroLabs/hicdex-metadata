{"__version": 1, "token_id": 695773, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Santiago", "description": "At first glance this would appear to be a bunch of colored lines on top of lines on top of squares and that would be technically correct.But there is so much more than meets the eye here.All throughout history line art has been used for more than just aesthetics it\u2019s been used to pass messages, secrets that would last beyond the sands of time. One of my favorite examples dates back to the 16th century with an angelic archetype by D\u00fcrer called \u201cMelencolia I\u201d and center point lines vector anterior beyond the background depicting divine presence not just an ambient sunrise gone a muck. The lady of wings embodied the 4 temperaments of Melancholy and if you look closely at the abundant markers of symbolism leading the viewer to the intended message, & validates that line art holds greater depth than we often credit. From the ancient Egyptians to Da Vinci himself, important messages were imbedded in quintessential art in hopes time would educate us enough to acknowledge, disseminate & comprehend failures of the past thus ensuring the future of mankind. \n\nSantiago consists of 5 pieces that are necessary to unlocking the secret encoded within this artwork. These will be larger editions & low tezos so anyone can try to solve this wicked code.

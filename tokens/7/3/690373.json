{"__version": 1, "token_id": 690373, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Art Practice #1 (Falling Through Life)", "description": "In this session I was determined to draw a difficult position using no reference. \n\nI started out buy just puking some lines on the page. The inspiration for the falling pose, and the clothing, was heavily inspired by Shinji Ikari from Neon Genesis: Evangelion. The show was largely on my mind at the time of drawing this. Depression, Escapism...are we forever destined to keep piloting the Eva?\n\nI was beginning to see myself in Shinji. I could relate to Anno, the creator of the series, and the difficulties he shared with his art. \n\nThis is when the drawing starts to be one of myself.\n\nOnce I got to the eyes I realized I had made a dire mistake in my brush choices. This is when I move from the \"pencil-course\" brush to the \"genius\" brush. \n\nThere is a large chunk of time towards the end where it seems still. This is me retracing the outside lines, filling them in. Much better brush choice.\n\nOops, almost forgot to ink the shirt lines. This is my first time doing cloths this way, cutting out the shadows before hand. I really suck at realistic clothing. Its almost as hard as hair...\n\nI wasnt really sure what to do with the \"Falling\" lines either. Hopefully they get the message across well enough.

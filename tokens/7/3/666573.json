BEE HIVE appears to have real-world volume to it. Obviously this is an illusion made by the repetition of letters and the layered effect of the words. The color shift within the words also adds to the illusion of three dimensionality. One of my favorite points of reference is the negative space line in the middle of the work. It separates the left to the right, but it also adds another layer of three dimensionality by the slight asymmetry of the word HIVE. BEE HIVE's themes of unity, strength, and intelligence candidly reflect my emotional mindset at the time.

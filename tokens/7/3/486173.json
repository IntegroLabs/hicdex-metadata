I hope that if you are watching this from somewhere else in the world that at least this is an interesting example of CLIP guided diffusion..", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ1zXLKe4hTvq6JkAHcuVxHMycAxKgRrCqEdn8p2TceWt", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcy89iiMEYaS56dGj2wxRXLwrkjs4Z8CmXoobuLMDmJRj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ1zXLKe4hTvq6JkAHcuVxHMycAxKgRrCqEdn8p2TceWt", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LwHHzSP3oX4Lwpf2oPD52tViuxGCjCZQv"], "tags": ["henhalloween", "hictober", "end_time", "mementomori", "snakepit", "GAN", "CLIP", "abstract", "horror", "halloween"], "extra": {}}

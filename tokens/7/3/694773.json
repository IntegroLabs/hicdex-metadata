(Well, yeah Andrew, there's COVID out there!) No, I'm not talking about that kind of mask. It's the type of masking that is the process by which someone hides, changes or \"masks\" their natural intuitive personality to match up to all the social pressures, abuse or harassment. Some people mask an overly dominant temperament with benign gaslighting. Others like myself, use humor to mask insecurity or pain. Environmental issues such as authoritarian parents, rejection, and emotional, physical, or sexual abuse can all have a significant impact on masking. Because masking can take various forms, an individual may not even realize they are doing it. Are you masking while reading this very sentence? What is your mask? How do you cope with life?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUyL3fSYgLq5BsTmfVjZmhAwss2xWb8h9v7p4r8WGRfau", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmek76w2jzLWPfVELq4Jfe5CGkZqYGJE4LgE7UPtgbgwUW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUyL3fSYgLq5BsTmfVjZmhAwss2xWb8h9v7p4r8WGRfau", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

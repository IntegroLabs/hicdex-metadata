Now, half a century later, as I share these in a digital marketplace full of artists hawking their wares, I hope these photos remind us all of the humanity behind the transactions. This photo was taken in Strasbourg, France, circa 1968.","tags":["photo","photography","vietnam","france","strasbourg","1968"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmRqqT7GXNzDXrn8gCXStNMXVSNSsDTzPtqpFtCYzeHUyK"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRqqT7GXNzDXrn8gCXStNMXVSNSsDTzPtqpFtCYzeHUyK","display_uri":"ipfs://QmQuWHSnTqvbiWRG3fJXpURXZxnv9E8YrpEAj69uibApPU","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, confabulation, dogma, illusion, hallucination, or some other misleading effects of perception, as individuals with those beliefs are able to change or readjust their beliefs upon reviewing the evidence.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeZ2X5xeeQEDvdDbx77JR92XaSDnbXQCsniK5AWhhBTyS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfYaMTme2zZVQvrqhdEM3bM5ZgJFixpnf3p1kAtJpRtE9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmQcUXwZYovn7rk2vEY11vDK7mqsnuFBEwvUX8axKNavgs", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeZ2X5xeeQEDvdDbx77JR92XaSDnbXQCsniK5AWhhBTyS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2GnRBWDdiWNJxfNKMUpV3N8QLWh8k5vdia"], "tags": ["illustration", "anime", "love", "animelover", "weebs"], "extra": {}}

Example: #FFFFFF = White & #000000 = Black. These color hex codes are integral to all HTML web design and have been vital as a way of representing color formats digitally. Playing off of this format, what would happen (hypothetically and fantastically) if we told a hexcode (We're anthropomorphizing hexcodes here people as sentient living creatures. It's weird, just go with it.) that we were fed up with their pedantic numbers and letters and that were going to stop using them and use the CMYK (Cyan / Magenta / Yellow / Black) format instead. Hexcode's response is what you see in the image. They're pissed off and not having any of it. They have zero F's to give, in fact they've absorbed all the F's that they could possibly take! Fun fact, the actual colors of the hexcodes are represented in the written hexcode numbers themselves.

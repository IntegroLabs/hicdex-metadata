{"__version": 1, "token_id": 676372, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "- Corpse tree -", "description": "There are many odd things - some magical, others mundane - to be found in deep forests. Perhaps one of the most ghastly is the arborius cadaverous, or corpse tree.\n\nThey are an oddity, even for Lume's menagerie. An amalgamate of flora and Undead, they occur when an old, sickly tree feeds from the bodies of the deceased; or the dying. Death is natural, particularly in the wild places, and it is common and right for bodies to break down to enrich the soil; but it takes more than a dead rodent or ailing vagabond to contaminate such a tree. The exposure must be more pronounced, the event more enduring; the site of a battle, massacre, or the location of repeated hangings. The roots of the soon-tainted tree learn to feed on the macabre nutrients, and the Anima contained within - much like a conventional, humanoid Undead - this way becoming Undead themselves. \n\nMore on this grim creature, and other denizens of Lume, can be found below:\n\nhttps://lumelibrary.com/index.php?title=Corpse_tree", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXKqbWfrNYS9tyqJCVZBX6B5K5Zx5mpfqG4N24aExYXT8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbGGiBnG9a2vRLFRkLo6GVm2Z2vkvDT2CFTmbzJLcdUx7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXKqbWfrNYS9tyqJCVZBX6B5K5Zx5mpfqG4N24aExYXT8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fqhYjbMFvYTvZ1WVMa7dPpyks4CYtpd1n"], "tags": ["illustration", "sketch", "pencil", "tree", "undead", "fantasy", "worldbuilding"], "extra": {}}

Digital Watercolor. FORMAT: Uncompressed PNG Image 6000x4100. My genesis green-NFT, a digital watercolor based on another project - Blood Resin Veiled Lady, my 3D sculpted and printed statuette using my own blood resin. The goal was to capture the color, material, and messy resin process of the physical counterpart which this is based on; a wild SLA printing experiment using my own blood, and a mixture of plant based UV bio-resin and dyes. https://www.instagram.com/p/CIJdPKsJXii/ ","tags":[],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmVN71oavceUhcW4u7LLpkoY6xz45NysYGU5k9MTSBz54Z"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVN71oavceUhcW4u7LLpkoY6xz45NysYGU5k9MTSBz54Z","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZwbNj5sUhHZJUVFKi4Rb4K48hwv22DGk4Vu7fcM3d9Sg","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

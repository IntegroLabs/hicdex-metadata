Built in 1921 by eccentrics Eleanor and George Bridges, the home was a gathering place for influential artists such as Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Earnest Hemingway. When I visited the property with the current owner I was allowed to observe the energy and see if I felt the presence of spirits. The garden feels like there\u2019s always an orchestra, a party that will never ever end. \n\nWhen you enter this part of the property you begin to feel transported to Europe. The arched passageways and vines, pockets of seating areas, each one perfect for sitting with coffee or wine for hours on end. There is a vivid presence of artists writing and creating here, planning theatrical productions, enjoying meals together until the end of time.

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 641772, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Loki", "description": "Loki  is a god in Norse mythology. According to some sources, Loki is the son of F\u00e1rbauti  and Laufey , and the brother of Helblindi and B\u00fdleistr. Loki is married to Sigyn and they have a son, Narfi and/or Nari. By the j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a, Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf Fenrir, and the world serpent J\u00f6rmungandr. Loki, in the form of a mare, was impregnated by the stallion  and gave birth to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir. Loki is referred to as the father of V\u00e1li in Prose Edda, though this source also refers to Odin as the father of V\u00e1li twice, and V\u00e1li is found mentioned as a son of Loki only once.\n\nLoki's relation with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves maliciously towards them. Loki is a shape shifter and in separate incidents appears in the form of a salmon, a mare, a fly, and possibly an elderly woman named  (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god Baldr, and eventually, V\u00e1li binds Loki with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, the goddess Ska\u00f0i is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of Ragnar\u00f6k, Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the j\u00f6tnar, at which time he will encounter the god Heimdallr, and the two will slay each other.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcqnAQDrZNCU5v3rx7SGQzr2TYA1t8w2ZmY5qv2eJQjRG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcqnAQDrZNCU5v3rx7SGQzr2TYA1t8w2ZmY5qv2eJQjRG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcqnAQDrZNCU5v3rx7SGQzr2TYA1t8w2ZmY5qv2eJQjRG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R4FrYfMq3J2hRxaanXSH7A1GRR9Sms6ZN"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

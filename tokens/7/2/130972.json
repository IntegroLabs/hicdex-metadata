He dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815.  One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in human history.  His lasting legal achievement, the Napoleonic Code, has been highly influential.  One of Napoleon's nicknames was ’Nightmare of Europe’ due to European nations being terrified of both his schemes for personal aggrandizement and his amazing military successes.

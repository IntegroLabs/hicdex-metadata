The partisans set up base camps (mil-yong \ubc00\uc601) in the mountains of the Baekdu-daegan and its highland regions. In the late 60s, by finding the slogan trees \uad6c\ud638\ub098\ubb34, the camps were re-founded and restored as historic sites where they are kept by staff donning the freedom fighter uniforms of that era. North Korea makes (used to) its own AK47s. One of my game scouts had one in Zambia. Lighter than the Russian version from memory.

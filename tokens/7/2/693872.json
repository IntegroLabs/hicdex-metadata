Come out with your punctuation held up where we can see them. You're under arrest. Joking all aside, if there is a person in this world that would either love or loathe this, it would be Richard Prince. This is somewhat of an ode to him as I've always loved his joke paintings from the '80s. I'm a sucker for a good one-liner or a knock-knock joke. The joke here is playing with the grammar sensitivities of knowing when to use to who or to whom. What is the difference and when should we use them? \"Who\" performs the action of a verb, while \"whom\" receives the action. In terms of grammar, that makes \"who\" a subject, and \"whom\" an object. When following a preposition, \"whom\" is the preferred choice. Does that clear it all up? Still confused? Good so is everyone else. lol", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcfDmXBEh4KWaeksRxWDRrXR4LFcPVPCLgstfpafnNQ65", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYwCJ1gwHouACGWHDxpukEAFgJhyeA6MwfWpHq7HGRRgW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcfDmXBEh4KWaeksRxWDRrXR4LFcPVPCLgstfpafnNQ65", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 692572, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Ratatoskr", "description": "In Norse mythology, Ratatoskr (generally considered to mean \"drill-tooth\" or \"bore-tooth\") is a squirrel who runs up and down the world tree Yggdrasil to carry messages between the eagle perched atop Yggdrasil, and the serpent N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr, who dwells beneath one of the three roots of the tree. Ratatoskr is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.\n\nThe name Ratatoskr contains two elements: rata- and -toskr. The element toskr is generally held to mean \"tusk\". Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson theorized that the rati- element means \"the traveller\". He says that the name of the legendary drill Rati may feature the same term. According to Vigf\u00fasson, Ratatoskr means \"tusk the traveller\" or \"the climber tusk.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf8wP1dxCFn16Q8t2fJc7n6CJfW8eJG3pwfTsRi6trz86", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaNaKsFVwKctVhMK7mnpyWX9JKp2b6CjFci7ZXL6Ef3Yb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf8wP1dxCFn16Q8t2fJc7n6CJfW8eJG3pwfTsRi6trz86", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Zrzs1sC9BHbRwtDgFrNC4fkZ5cXMw83ch"], "tags": ["codeart", "generativeart", "beast", "minimalart", "abstract", "mythology", "mathart", "psychedelic", "minimal", "darkart"], "extra": {}}

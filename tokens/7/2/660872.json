{"__version": 1, "token_id": 660872, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Veritas", "description": "Developed in the late Roman Republic, Verism was a highly realistic approach to figurative sculpture. In contrast to the idealized proportions of Classical Greece, characteristics of Veristic sculpture focused on a more \u2018truthful\u2019 and almost hyperreal depiction of wrinkles and imperfection - symbolic of wisdom and ancestry. \n\nVeritas translates to truth. My work seeks to explore the truth of the human condition and what it means to be alive. This piece is both a representation of consciousness and a societal critique. The truth is not black and white but shades of gray and the world is an array of contrasts. Opposing elements like growth, decay, beauty, destruction, order and chaos all exist together. \n\nDigital Painting | 3500 x 5000", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSTjEU2igrNhc2e42RM4rEBeeA1pHGNHPncXFjCLtypv1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZv862Nfqm6nToTXxGuWviPTSov8xSgeBvJZcTacDjWaQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSTjEU2igrNhc2e42RM4rEBeeA1pHGNHPncXFjCLtypv1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QSnow3mcoEoeKsk4oQuJsNRTx8H3cJzHQ"], "tags": ["anatomy", "psychology", "abstraction", "consciousness", "painting"], "extra": {}}

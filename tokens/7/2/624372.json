Something I made when I was 15 years old as an aspiring artist and photographer, but never published. I just created for fun. I\u2019m now 30 and am finally sharing this piece and many more I\u2019ve found from my old CD and USB drives. This is a photo I took of St. Matthew's Church in Walsall, UK. A beautiful grade II* listed building built around 1220 with some parts re-built in 1820. I then edited it in Photosuite to create a grungy inverted glitch style. As I was an emo scene teen! :)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSBP67rgJ8VMRaB5jbXeguZCJTe4tscPBxEgaPycXTqs7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSKJYkA3vqdooWdY8Xj942Sc2YtyimQAYaBtHBbg5QGn9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSBP67rgJ8VMRaB5jbXeguZCJTe4tscPBxEgaPycXTqs7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iYYUZaS5uxbrfCBEnWvAAcFTqxomTx8wW"], "tags": ["sianvictoria", "sianvictoria", "glitch", "grunge", "inverted", "photography", "digitalart", "artphotography", "church", "temple", ""], "extra": {}}

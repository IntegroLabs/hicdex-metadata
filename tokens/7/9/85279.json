The video was uploaded to TikTok on 6/4/2020 and has  accrued over 728k views at the time of this tweet.  I am minting this video on my brother's behalf in order  to raise funds to repair damage caused by his recent  sequence of bad luck. He threw a metal BB at his friend's car on a hot Florida afternoon and comepletely shattered his windshield. He was also involved in a minor fender-bender a few days later. Cars are complicated.","tags":["videoart","tiktok","meme","viral","funny"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmWgpLZHn7zGpBhbhHMB4sBqzsRmYLewRLkjxrw4kXRofb"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWgpLZHn7zGpBhbhHMB4sBqzsRmYLewRLkjxrw4kXRofb","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

No one knows what she looks like.\n\nEngaos is well respected in the colony, and champions the downtrodden. No one dares cross him.\n\nKawachi had been assaulted in the alleys of the colony before, but those who assaulted did not live to see another day. She is a fierce fighter who got her cyborg body after the attack.\n\nSchmitt is the witch of the crew. She lays low and stays hidden most of the time. She is able to telepathically communicate with the rest of the crew, and see through the eyes of her Pigmy Hooter familiar.\n\nFynida seems like a regular elite teenager who loves fun things like bunnies and tacos. But she hides a dark secret, a dark past, that has made her set on rebelling against the Queen.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWey65ByVE6rAdEpuf1aqR8gRLXRWx7KnyhALMZHpusok", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVAvkYAhC2Xdt1QXzTJGcXubc5DuSUz7fsFaLXjcYZe6s", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWey65ByVE6rAdEpuf1aqR8gRLXRWx7KnyhALMZHpusok", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MFSFxekD6BGbuLDYcGBZn6Gxgqu7TB8Fq"], "tags": ["VesselsGen0", "Vessels", "Scifi", "Crew", "Worldbuilding"], "extra": {}}

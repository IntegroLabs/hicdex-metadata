The 2nd of the Monochrome designs. I've made a bunch of pieces about television and entertainment but if I was only able to watch 1 thing for the rest of my life it would be Seinfeld. I distinctly remember watching the last 3 or 4 seasons as they aired on television leading up to the series finale in 1998. Even back then Seinfeld was already in syndication and I recorded every episode on VHS and then dubbed them onto separate tapes and cut out all the commercials. AND when my ex and I broke up before I met my wife I was crushed, I moved into a 250 sq/ft apartment, didn't even own a tv and ended up SOLELY watching Seinfeld DVDs on my laptop for over a years straight! So needless to say Seinfeld has meant quite a bit to me over the last 30 years.

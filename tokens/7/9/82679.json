It’s an ethos for the unstable world we all live in now. As an ethos for life, it means understanding what’s really important & not giving it up. It means taking brave, smart risks and looking at the long term return. It also means hodling your nerve when people think you’re nuts. A series of 4 flavors, this one is double chocolate with a hint of espresso.","tags":["cake","food","cute","kawaii","3D","chocolate","gold","coffee"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmYSQV6rmsDrrcWqiqA3FBUZxFfMJZ85Gv5UnsAtfgEugw"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYSQV6rmsDrrcWqiqA3FBUZxFfMJZ85Gv5UnsAtfgEugw","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

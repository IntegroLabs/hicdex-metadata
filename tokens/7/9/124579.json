It's incredible how this industry overlooks this potential.” was tweeted by @muratpak on 06/06/2021. I can relate to that as personally I'm struggling in understanding how to make audio noticed in the NFT realm for what it deserves: people rely mainly on Twitter and Instagram for their research, scrolling quickly through the feed and stopping only for something catchy TO THE EYES. With this “London views” project I try to place my audio pieces on the spotlight, and for doing that I use ordinary, loopy, almost boring video contents filmed by myself. Episode “04” technicalities: music part “2021 07” produced in June 2021 and video filmed still in June 2021 at StarLane DLR station in London, UK.

But it is not reality as we experience it. It is a reality-based on images found on the internet. The dataset used to train generative networks (such as ILSVRC, or LSUN) contains massive of images found in google images and text prompts associated with them. These images were captured by people using services such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. Then based on this captioning, the algorithm learns to classify objects.\nSo when you try to generate an image, you tap into the collective internet unconscious of what people think represents different aspects of reality (different words).\u00a0\nGenerative ML algorithm extracts what is most prominent in those pictures and creates an amalgamation of it. This creates interesting results, especially when you try to generate abstractions. The term abstractions are used as something that is not easily defined. Art, for example.\u00a0\nIn this work, I try to explore the internet collective unconscious and biases associated with it. Buy generative a massive of terms and looking what ML dream, when try to replicate them.\u00a0", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSgbKgHnP1RxpNq2mgNGgtfqnUoHYsPKTPjwphr1cam6z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSgbKgHnP1RxpNq2mgNGgtfqnUoHYsPKTPjwphr1cam6z", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSgbKgHnP1RxpNq2mgNGgtfqnUoHYsPKTPjwphr1cam6z", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PKx8D35ttAfAWsq5rm2mxLRDnfMpJSrnd"], "tags": ["Ai", "ML", "DiscoDiffusion", "DigitalArt", "MachineLearning", "Generative"], "extra": {}}

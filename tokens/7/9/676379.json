The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses modified bacterial CRISPR components to direct target-specific cutting of double-stranded DNA. The cell\u2019s own DNA repair machinery then takes over to fix the break in a manner that modifies the genetic sequence that has been cut. This MoleculART depicts the Cas9 protein with associated guide RNA that targets a specific spot in the genome. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 for this development of genome editing.\n\nberry venom colors util.mroll 1, 180, 1 \nX-RAY DIFFRACTION 3.40 \u00c5\nBakR d0mains cas.wrapped\nlimited 500 eds. only ever minted", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVurQrVSNKHHM98PPz3iCDcZmEhaPrZr6zAQvchmxwdAd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcntT5AunCMx1cQw5m78wXoikcMXnpPetTBPsVfdsA7TH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVurQrVSNKHHM98PPz3iCDcZmEhaPrZr6zAQvchmxwdAd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2Ku5oXWWxHnkf81Y5s5Kf2o67cymF7iG3Z"], "tags": ["nobel", "doudna", "charpentier", "genome", "diffraction", "CRISPR", "cas9", "5f9r", "bakrd0mains", "science", "xray", "stem", "moleculart", "sciart"], "extra": {}}

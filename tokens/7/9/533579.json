At first, this seemed like a petty and irrational move, but further investigation and insight shows that the founder, Rafa, was from the beginning fighting to keep control of his creation.  \n\nDue to the rapid growth of HIC ET NUNC  after launch, the site became a target for hackers, cliques of users that wanted to mold the site to fit what they saw as norms, other people looking to create side projects that in one way or the other looked to eat off of Hic's plate, and Rafa faced heavy pressure from its users to implement upgrades.   All of these people forgot one thing.. HIC ET NUNC was Rafa's -- not theirs.  It was his \"experiment\" as he said from the very beginning.   \n\nRafa stood up to the challenges until the straw finally broke the camel's back and he left. While his sudden departure could have been handled better, the community could have also handled the man's vision better. \n\nRafa was a righteous man, a principled man.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeM5Y9AcFtzTmsrb3U2emHaMWe5HmGDAw5GuiJTSoVHf5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeM5Y9AcFtzTmsrb3U2emHaMWe5HmGDAw5GuiJTSoVHf5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeM5Y9AcFtzTmsrb3U2emHaMWe5HmGDAw5GuiJTSoVHf5", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1N1F4Ss8c2FHiaUrvVMxRCX859k9K7ui1P"], "tags": ["hicetnunc", "hen", "hic", "rafa", "philosophy", "cryptocurrency"], "extra": {}}

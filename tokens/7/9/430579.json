{"__version": 1, "token_id": 430579, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Chakra", "description": "Chakras are various focal points used in a variety of ancient meditation practices, collectively denominated as Tantra, or the esoteric or inner traditions of Hinduism.\n\nThe concept is found in the early traditions of Hinduism. Beliefs differ between the Indian religions, with many Buddhist texts consistently mentioning five chakras, while Hindu sources offer six or seven. Early Sanskrit texts speak of them both as meditative visualizations combining flowers and mantras and as physical entities in the body. Within kundalini yoga, the techniques of breath exercises, visualizations, mudras, bandhas, kriyas, and mantras are focused on manipulating the flow of subtle energy through chakras.\n\nThe modern Western chakra system arose from multiple sources, starting in the 1880s, followed by Sir John Woodroffe's 1919 book The Serpent Power, and Charles W. Leadbeater's 1927 book The Chakras, which introduced the seven rainbow colours for the chakras. Psychological and other attributes, and a wide range of supposed correspondences with other systems such as alchemy, astrology, gemstones, homeopathy, Kabbalah and Tarot were added later.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP4nd34JQZD1pYAahRo6rR8cSHM56ToAMFhG8CWxmRVrw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWqfeqdZrFWCJEqPaRTUo2DicQ7hEuFGUnEguSiXP76Wx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP4nd34JQZD1pYAahRo6rR8cSHM56ToAMFhG8CWxmRVrw", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1bKsxzCobsdVgg6Eamoj11FupanhXWy7Ax"], "tags": ["bandhas", "kriyas", "mantras", "JohnWoodroffe", "Chakras", "mudras", "meditation", "Hinduism", "Indian", "Buddhist", "Sanskrit", "kundalini", "yoga", "ardavan_homayounfar", "hicetnunc2000", "colorful", "hen200k", "nftartist", "abstract", "nfts", "henpro", "interactive", "processing", "colourful", "blender", "c4d", "3d", "glb", ""], "extra": {}}

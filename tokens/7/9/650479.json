Around three years ago, I was found almost dead and unconscious after being pushed off a cliff and supposedly my family was kidnapped... yet somehow I have zero memory of what happened or who my family even was. When I woke up in the hospital that day, I couldn\u2019t even remember who I even was for that matter.\n\nThe only thing I remember is something that happened right before I fell and it keeps coming back to me every night... that scared and fearful look in my daughter's eyes as she held out her hand to try and save me. I tried reaching out to her, but I just kept falling further and further away and when she herself realized it was too late, she screamed out \u201cthe password is 1923!\u201d before I remember hitting the ground.\n\nI'm now a special agent of the FBI trying to find answers for what happened that day. Despite losing all of my memory, I was given the power to look directly into someone's own inner psyche and see when their heart is hiding the truth. With it, I'm going to crack this case and find out what happened, I swear it!\n\nAs our team continues to investigate, we're all finding out that the case and my own life altogether was somehow much more complicated than we all initially hoped. Who am I exactly, where is my family, what is this password and most importantly: why do I have this power?\n\n\u2014---\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied.

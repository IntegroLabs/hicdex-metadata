The most widespread description portrays the Wolpertinger as having the head of a hare, the body of a squirrel, the antlers of a deer, and the wings and occasionally the legs of a bird.\n\nStuffed \"wolpertingers\", composed of parts of actual stuffed animals, are often displayed in inns or sold to tourists as souvenirs in the animals' \"native regions\". The Deutsches Jagd- und Fischereimuseum in Munich, Germany features a permanent exhibit on the creature.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUHCkpXgSVTj2qRyUKPFDKvQde3CnP7iCxoMUcKmw2xow", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfMVKaQ3T5oPgV7mTSAEi1bdUCXSyHfdTruVh99VVzuVH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUHCkpXgSVTj2qRyUKPFDKvQde3CnP7iCxoMUcKmw2xow", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Zrzs1sC9BHbRwtDgFrNC4fkZ5cXMw83ch"], "tags": ["codeart", "generativeart", "beast", "mythology", "folklore", "minimalart", "abstract", "mathart", "psychedelic", "minimaldarkart"], "extra": {}}

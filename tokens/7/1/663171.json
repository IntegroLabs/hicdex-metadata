The Hyperreal is an incredibly intriguing concept which is even more astounding considering Jean Baudrillard coined the phrase in his book Simulacra and Simulation, IN THE YEAR 1981! There are 2 all too relevant scenarios in our modern society; 1 is the possibility that we as beings with supposed free will are living in a simulation AND 2, the idea that if and when we spend too much time online or in a virtual world that we start to lose the ability to tell the 2 apart. The first is completely hypothetical because how would we know? But the 2nd scenario is something the Metaverse and Web 3.0 are actively building towards as we speak. When Baudrillard published these ideas do you think this is what he imagined? Is it possible that we really are part of a simulation and he was just part of it...and just writing revolutionary ideas that he already knew were true? Good question!

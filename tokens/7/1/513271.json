It is analogous to me with some kind of a complex biomechanical entity plugged into a dark environment and it is just waking up from an embryonic state. There is an erotick struggle embedded within... \nI invite you to meditate on it to discover more analogies as you watch it.\n\nXenorelics - Birth is one of the best works in the series. It`s about Movement, Fight, Sex, Harmony, Unconscious anxieties and Fears. It's like making a Rorschach blot and discovering the meaning of it at the same time. My greatest inspiration is HR Giger's organic art. There is a secret project I am working on at the moment that is connected to this artwork.\n\nThe original painting is actually hanging in my living room! It is one of my favorites.\n\nOwn one of the 10 of these unique pieces now before I reveal the secret big game project I am working on at the moment.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPZ6CWphU2GgMHUiYp5jRfu5iMrC83w5DHNZjmU6mS754", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVBijaWuhkZcyHzVKytcP9RiJG47AohKnTrk7KH46Mpe2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPZ6CWphU2GgMHUiYp5jRfu5iMrC83w5DHNZjmU6mS754", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L1rdDzjGNx5B6SSfRGiWvTmi94FH4XVSP"], "tags": ["Alien", "blackandwhite", "surreal", "fine", "art", "abstract", "giger", "originalart", "art", "surreal", "artifact", "darknft"], "extra": {}}

Its symbolic significance appears, at once, contradictory. The rat is a sewer-dweller, a bottom-feeder, vermin, pest, an affliction of poverty. Not nobility, royalty, or wealth. However, this embodiment of paradoxical nature is precisely its purpose. The task of the rat in our urban ecology, is to consume all that which is perceived to be waste. The rat teaches us that nature wastes nothing, and what is worthless to one being, becomes an abundance of sustenance to another. The rat\u2019s \u2018nobility\u2019 lies in its capacity to thrive and create abundance, in what first appears to be an inhospitable environment. In this case, the Royal Rat reflects the paradoxical oxymoron of abundant scarcity - the challenge laid down by John Karel. We mint the Royal Rat to respond to the HENthousand challenge, and celebrate the thriving, inspiring, and promising abundance of H=N.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRJ1eWPQnwwsBv14yP6ryqzFTvaLrAdS7gVJ2u4YzL7y9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWXpujAFQ2b5usTEL715k6uVLV6Gb2sG7xVPEFDtausuX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRJ1eWPQnwwsBv14yP6ryqzFTvaLrAdS7gVJ2u4YzL7y9", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gWDVuEL5bi7fRLhXMX3sbBHFc3a4YuibY"], "tags": ["HENthousand", "jjjjjjjjjjohn", "totemanimal", "rat", "animation", "loop", "psychedelic", "AI-generated", "methodicalmonkeys"], "extra": {}}

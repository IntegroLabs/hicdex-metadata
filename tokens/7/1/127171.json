Red as its is, its UV reflection work as a spotlight for pollinators, saving them from resource scarcity during harsh dry, sunny and cold winters. Also, when pollinated it generates a fava just like beans and peas, but this ones, explodes suddenly when a certain atmospheric and material dryness is reached, popping the seeds far away.

JUST US OUT IN SPACE; A SEA; SEE US, NOTICE US. End the violence against people of color. End the fear mongering. End the racism. End the senseless killings. Hold onto hope. Begin the healing. Begin to anew. Proceed forward. Lift each other up. We are all one. Let the message sink in you like an anchor in an endless sea of grief of the families left behind from all of these tragedies and yet be bouyed by the love, compassion, and understanding of truth and reconciliation. Love will always conquer hate, if we care.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUvk23kLEu6dmRc27GjZt6qE6hvWDmL98TD6BUpNCJvKx", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmeh2NC4vGdEAAAs2LrMCfpaV3cvFsq3oB1tzikXXjmdLP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUvk23kLEu6dmRc27GjZt6qE6hvWDmL98TD6BUpNCJvKx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

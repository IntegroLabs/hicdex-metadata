The creative rebellious spirit of the artist no longer obliges to draw only to order. Tezoscommunity supports each other, so this is the best place for you to start, and maybe not just start. We draw primarily for ourselves, not for the NFT, but the NFT is a great investment in yourself. The industrial and social revolutions freed the hands and minds of people, so there will only be more creative people, as well as collectors. Decentralized transactions on Tezos have a clear open account and we have nothing to hide. We do not buy or sell anything illegal or immoral. Tezos is also not mined, and this is an environmental concern. This economic model is a perfect example of the economy of the future of our planet.

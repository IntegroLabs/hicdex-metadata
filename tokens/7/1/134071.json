The life of a princess is a glamourous and opulent one, but rarely very lengthy. It’s all too easy to draw The Queen’s ire. Knowing this, Princess Martha lives each day as if it is her last. But not in a fun way, in more of a ‘living in constant fear’ kind of way.","tags":["Vessels","Vesslecollectibles","Princess","Power","Insistedonbeingblondeeventhoughsheisbrunette:)"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmaRkETNC9atD5ycCVq2V21Sjws2X4MkW6gnraHRtneyJB","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaRkETNC9atD5ycCVq2V21Sjws2X4MkW6gnraHRtneyJB","display_uri":"ipfs://Qma8qzbRfVYLTDzox6W9x9Dd5zm519sbkYB2xTn3DY2BMZ","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

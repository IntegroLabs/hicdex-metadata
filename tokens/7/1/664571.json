But all those patterns are no more than a dance of shadows in Plato's cave. Light dissolves them. Illusions are real and reality is an illusion. And as every simulacrum, it contains nothing but emptiness.\n\n\n.\nTWISTERS is a project about inconstant and changeable human nature and about different ways people may react to something that doesn't fit their expectations. Based on a wordplay when the word \"twist\" can have several meanings.\n.\n\nOriginal animation 2000x2000 px, 30 fps. \nInitially minted in edition of 10 copies.\nTWISTERS is the original series of abstract animated artworks by Olga Feldman.\n\nDedicated to those who keeps silence.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSyVC8sANnnwTKRrtwLhQKXDjRBG7VZPGfG1kywB8uGSB", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme7i6PaVa9UkgJnLKwHu3qiPaindes2Wh245Xmk2p64QD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSyVC8sANnnwTKRrtwLhQKXDjRBG7VZPGfG1kywB8uGSB", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WRAn7Dsjumd3swbv1YFKpKTwyKsRHzF2S"], "tags": ["monochrome", "twisters", "twister", "black", "white", "3d", "motion"], "extra": {}}

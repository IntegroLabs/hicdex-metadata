{"__version": 1, "token_id": 647171, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "UNDERWATER", "description": "UNDERWATER is an experiment using syntax repetition, gradients, and how the subtlety of a gradient can direct a narrative of the actual word UNDERWATER itself. Translation: We're recreating the moment of the act of going under the water line. The areas of where the gradient in the words mixes and blends into the background is that very line. The top part is above the water and the area beneath the faded gradient is underneath the water line. It's subtle and succinct. Making work in the most minimalistic way possible is the ultimate achievement. Sometimes the work calls for an almost child-like naivete and some beckon an intense complexity. Every word is different; every scenario a new challenge.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSRtTe21yQeTG3YtiR49zoeqc63mpcQwRNHe4M9jn6e3D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ18ZWCb2o6F6hvQVCBETqnxTeeXfkEpUwzFx8CAYg37S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSRtTe21yQeTG3YtiR49zoeqc63mpcQwRNHe4M9jn6e3D", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

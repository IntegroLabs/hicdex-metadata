R. R. Tolkien's favorite words were \"CELLAR DOOR\". Not that any of my artistic dribble is remotely deserving to be compared to his, but when I hear these words, it makes me think of Gandalf from Tolkien's timeless Lord of the Rings trilogy and his epic journey through Middle Earth. And then I say the words again and I hear Annoying Ted Sourcerer and begin my own quest to understand who this annoying Ted the amazing person who can source things is. How did this Ted get in my head? Am I experiencing the same thing Tolkien did when he thought of the words \"Cellar Door\"? Did he secretly hear the words as, sell a door? Absurd! But Annoying Ted Sourcerer, does exist in reality. Teddy is my life partner and I've realized that I'm the one annoying him with my work. That poor man has to endure endless nights of me talking about words/homophones/grammar/blah blah blah. Someone give him a medal for mental endurance to deal with me. I love you Teddy with all my heart. You are my anointed sorcerer. You are my cellar door. You are the one I want to go on quests with for the rest of my life. (Wait...did you just write a love letter to your life partner in the middle of a book using references to J.R.R.Tolkien? Wow...Andrew, you've crossed into nerd territory.)

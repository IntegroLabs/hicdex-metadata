{"__version": 1, "token_id": 475371, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SLOWBURN", "description": "\nThe World is full with terrible things, we all will burn slowly and turn to ashes, and we will rise again to be alive and then get burnt again. Being ashes again and still burnt, until nothing left from us because everything will fade away by the grace of wind and blend with the solid soil. The heat of the sun can burn everything that stand in the ground. But the shadow of the sun is the only place we can hide. Happiness, sorrow, grief, and hope. They will come and go as long as the great Sunshine still rises and falls.\n\n2015\nArtwork: Vidi Nurhadi Ranadipura\nPhotographer: Burhan Amaludin\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSP7Z3Puqf2Crdb4uP7LnTARveyx2D5UgWjUL5WP7S6YF", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf6zr4jpL8nAEiF3hGM3thmzV4i2jeUs9sWSJjoASPkfo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSP7Z3Puqf2Crdb4uP7LnTARveyx2D5UgWjUL5WP7S6YF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XEXE3YqNBYfWVentyoWhNA1FGcHpV64DC"], "tags": ["maternaldisaster", "maternaldisaster", "slowburn", "forever16", "photography", "artinstallation"], "extra": {}}

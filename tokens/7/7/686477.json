I'm a film and TV junky. When I was interning in NYC I got to work on the editorial layout of a Rizzoli book about the film industry and we were provided with HUNDREDS of photos from film and behind the scenes on films. I was searching through my computer when i started this project and it turns out I had a whole folder of those photos including this image of Madonna from Suddenly Seeking Susan and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. I love the escapism of entertainment though I don't really have much to complain about it my real life. I just love being able to experience the worlds and stories of people and lives that are different than my own, even just for a few minutes or hours at a time. That is the beauty of the metaverse, you will not only be able to watch these other lives but you will be able to EXPERIENCE them like never before.

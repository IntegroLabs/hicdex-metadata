Sajjad H. Rizvi (intellectual historian and associate professor of Islamic intellectual history and Islamic studies at the University of Exeter) has called Avicenna \"arguably the most influential philosopher of the pre-modern era\". He was a Muslim Peripatetic philosopher influenced by Greek Aristotelian philosophy. Of the 450 works he is believed to have written, around 240 have survived, including 150 on philosophy and 40 on medicine.\n\nHis most famous works are The Book of Healing, a philosophical and scientific encyclopedia, and The Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia which became a standard medical text at many medieval universities and remained in use as late as 1650.\n\nBesides philosophy and medicine, Avicenna's corpus includes writings on astronomy, alchemy, geography and geology, psychology, Islamic theology, logic, mathematics, physics and works of poetry.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcowVbELo7KxY1vmVj2Bn5WCDpGBUyzDwfHcxRzyo1Zxc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUXxSWupNDy8BxoBdwyDpx5UrDxFPjEYZ9Np8nkJk1UKY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcowVbELo7KxY1vmVj2Bn5WCDpGBUyzDwfHcxRzyo1Zxc", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2WCHSSnwGmXt6CiHUXhLwgZvuEji3sc8Gv"], "tags": ["avicenna", "collageart", "mp4", "ibnsina", "history", "philosopher"], "extra": {}}

This is the 3rd piece featuring my personal toy collection this time from a company named Coarse Toys and their quintessential mascot \"Float\" released for their 10th Anniversary in 2014. These figures originally came out in conjunction with Vans and they even made a 1:1 version that was around 6 Feet tall that was in select Vans stores around the world. These trucks are his literal head BUT it does come with a standard humanoid head and when you swap it his name is then \"Flake.\" This came in a 2 pack with another figure named \"Fluid\" that is a surfer, and are some of the most immaculately sculpted figures in my collection. Coarse is still producing figures today albeit in an even more mind blowing capacity and have expanded their character stable to several new and expansive personalities.

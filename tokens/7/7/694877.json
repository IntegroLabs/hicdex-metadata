They travel from planet to planet exploring all there is to see and bring back trinkets and interesting or helpful items they finds along the way.\n\n\nTheir whole bodies are luminescent as they draw their energy from the magnetic fields of the planets they explore.  It is said that fire dragon eggs are thrown into stars by their mothers where they incubate until the death of the star. \n\nThey are born fully grown with all the knowledge of their parents; they continue to add to that knowledge their entire lives.  Fire dragons are very tall and use their big wings to travel five times faster than the speed of light.\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUsXGbZXEucg9ZNgdhk78mPGxuvn97nAfBzy6oY1msGnv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaWYyB1hAfPNReawE7GHyGqWA5sf1NauZd9ouR7Go9q8L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUsXGbZXEucg9ZNgdhk78mPGxuvn97nAfBzy6oY1msGnv", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld", "myth", "myths", "dragon", "dragons"], "extra": {}}

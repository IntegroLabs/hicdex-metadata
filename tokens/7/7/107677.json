Life is a great web of events that make us who we are. It is formed by present, past and future and we are the center of these three spaces in time. It is possible to touch, see, feel, taste. It is possible to dive and climb. It is possible to hurt, break and rebuild. To learn and forget. It is possible to use the past to transform and not to do the same things over again. The past gives us the opportunity to build a new present so that the future is different, better. All within the great web of Space and time of life.

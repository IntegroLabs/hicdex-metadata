Just as you don't know until you see it, you will never be sure after you wake up. \nWhat makes you go there is a question you ask in your sleep. If it has been decided that you deserve to know the answer, you will meet with a spotter who will accompany you on the way. This spotter will deliver you to one of the upper ancestry women of the planet Ghana, where you will receive the answer to your question. You'll see the road, but then you'll forget. So you have only one right and very little time to ask what you really want to know.\n\n\u0130les: Splendor, elegance, beauty, sex", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUobtnxNKiB6Lj7Q4Hc1Lw6aHQakT44YhCnnTZUFGA5WT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmakF2Ap7bXD9oVw18SBWm9LfyjtZAghSwqwpHwiu3p5fi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUobtnxNKiB6Lj7Q4Hc1Lw6aHQakT44YhCnnTZUFGA5WT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1KykC9PqgC4Qmd9XLQA32mkFwM2eQEVCwb"], "tags": ["photography", "experimentalphotography", "experimentalportrait", "darkart", "darkportrait", "surrealphotography", "surrealportrait"], "extra": {}}

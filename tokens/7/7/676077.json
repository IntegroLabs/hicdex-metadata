He stares at us, accusatory, challenging us for daring to intrude on this moment: had we stopped his train of thought as he was on the verge of a papal illumination - or does he simply struggle to go through the motions with people watching him? We may never know, especially as his death in 1655 further shrouds this in mystery. But this is a moment we can all relate to, and shows that the noblest man of god and the humblest of souls are all equal when we're sat astride our porcelain throne.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWkALchuodJBozJbdXDGUApogp4gLHfhuTcYWKujqZYeK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ5pgJLfRV553HNRi1bdDp2uaoLrEu8ztMJuCy7kxNguu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmSLPCrLb9nhMxRSUQnGQ5cA2jg9AsVa6vy3B1w3gvFvgh", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWkALchuodJBozJbdXDGUApogp4gLHfhuTcYWKujqZYeK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QwzhyGp3mk8ZCsFmQnSgx5cEX9sMjYsfT"], "tags": ["collage", "pope", "Cardinali", "toilets", "Andrex"], "extra": {}}

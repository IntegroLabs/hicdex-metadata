It's a portal made of obsidian activated with fire. It allows the user to travel to the Nether. As cool as this sounds, the Nether is, ironically, a hell of a nightmare. Creatures from your worst nightmare are present her, ready to hunt you. Only a few have came back through the portal alive (others respawned near their bed).

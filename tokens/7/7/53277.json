Our family was excited and abuzzed with a new baby! It is a bright yellow parrot and it is bringing so much joy to us.... And frustrations too. You see, Bebe has become very close to me as I handfed her 3 times a day when she was still a chick. This went on for many months until she was able to eat solid food by her own. Now she has grown very close to me and would squawk incessantly, calling for attention.","tags":["bird","contemporaryart","fineart","parrot"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmTNHosGxPcVchvWmSXWA4EPUJEM7udbznuiLh9vARi14T"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTNHosGxPcVchvWmSXWA4EPUJEM7udbznuiLh9vARi14T","display_uri":"ipfs://QmfF1oYHiHesyUk2VbyUq9YozPDWVGVo2TqrjLoW1BYWWt","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Please Stand By, For A Nuclear Holocaust. Russia has, against international law, invaded the Ukraine and started the first European land war since 2014. Russia\u2019s army was quickly humiliated as the far smaller, less funded Ukrainian army, consisting of many everyday civilians, held back wave after wave of Russian troops. And while Russia will undoubtedly eventually overtake Ukrainian forces, international sanctions have demolished Russias economy, halving the value of the rubble and wiping nearly 300billion USD worth of money. In response Putin has put Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent forces on high alert, and many fear military action against Russia in the name of Ukraine could lead to all out nuclear war. With Putin seemingly unhinged and possibly mentally unstable it seems that like the only thing that could prevent this catastrophe is someone from within his circle finally taking him out. I STAND WITH UKRAINE. I STAND AGAINST PUTIN.\t", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTBZKFLQQtUdqDGRzq21SBBfn1qJUhHvLjS5FKNnuM4pX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYndqii2czKATYxT65fUxns591kdzMq2bkTvjfJkovkrt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTBZKFLQQtUdqDGRzq21SBBfn1qJUhHvLjS5FKNnuM4pX", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}

A long time ago, some partners told me that I was \"too intense\". Of course, I always feel too much, I don't know why. But when I love, I love more than anyone, when I cry, I cry more than ever.\n\nBut, I learn to save my tears in a old box and try to be more sweet, more strong, show strenght and ignore everything I feel.\n\nBut those tears are mine, are for me: for my life, for the love I've lost, for my open wounds, for my childhood, for the goodbyes.\n\nThose tears are made of moon, but I'm crying facing the sun. Those tears are full of magic, and they are mine.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRyGFu8aq4CCJ5NXPtmmx5F7qrWKpZbnczRYwU2UaZC48", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb7xkmAUExNQyBzraSh1tpW79xGn9o5yYL1WXu9zhzCZ6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRyGFu8aq4CCJ5NXPtmmx5F7qrWKpZbnczRYwU2UaZC48", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QeQDHicCFxnvBzeTewdaKqKRfU2VCHHGn"], "tags": ["selfportrait", "tears", "lights"], "extra": {}}

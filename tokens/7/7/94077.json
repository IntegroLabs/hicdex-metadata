In this temple, there are various gods created by the local people. Among them is a car god who holds a steering wheel in his hand to bless pilgrims with safe journeys on the roads ahead.  Many people who saw this temple in the news adopted a mocking attitude and thought it was absurd, but Zhao Zijian began to wonder if this was the original power of belief?  Who can tell the taxi driver who prays to the ‘god’ with the steering wheel that his ‘god’ is not ‘god’? Who are we to tell others that their ‘gods’ are not real ‘gods’? The themes of reverence and how belief is a personal act are brought out in this Tao Foundry Exclusive New Gods Are Coming.","tags":["digital","art",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmSJ4e3r5yuFQqcFMaffhTWbYzicKPNPZGooBH6BYGnr24"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSJ4e3r5yuFQqcFMaffhTWbYzicKPNPZGooBH6BYGnr24","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

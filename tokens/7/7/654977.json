The subject is inspired by the design concept of The Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album cover. The zebra crossing design became iconic through this image. This project takes this concept and becomes an exploration in the artist\u2019s style and environment. These locations can be visited physically through latitude and longitude or virtually via NFTs that exist on the Tezos blockchain.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTp8acNAAMJM5uXD5KULkc1xzr2uhywe2p8HvmVLe6W4w", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNWq8utF5hdWhnhXQgehsWmwWDmDz9HZXYHmYgMhSnLWb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTp8acNAAMJM5uXD5KULkc1xzr2uhywe2p8HvmVLe6W4w", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Pce9wMy4r3pWFsc5zHMB55vr6V66kWM7a"], "tags": ["photography", "fitxtezos", "collage", "manhattan", "nyc", "photo", "allegedly", "popart", "newyorkcity", "fit", "street", "traffic", "cars"], "extra": {}}

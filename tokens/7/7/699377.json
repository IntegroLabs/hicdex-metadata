On this day, I was pondering the stories that my mother and father would tell me about listening to the radio back in the 1950s / 1960s / 1970s. Radios were an essential real part of life to so many people, especially the youth culture forming within each successive decade. If you wanted to be on the up and up of what music artist was doing, you needed to listen to the radio. Over time with the advent of the internet and its subsequent influence over music and culture, the consumption levels of radio have dwindled immensely. I can only speak for myself, but radio is not longer the way I find and listen to new music or get my news or learn about culture. I made this as a fond farewell to an old friend...RADIOS...ADIOS...AI...DIOS. Radios...via con dios, te amo para siempre.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWDLJopSWoFFkZfUeXTEmQiJ3UouXqHhphAbJPkpP9Lek", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXe9iXRTqnfLd6J76Nff5nh2FTinueN7GpoB1AoVS7M2d", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWDLJopSWoFFkZfUeXTEmQiJ3UouXqHhphAbJPkpP9Lek", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

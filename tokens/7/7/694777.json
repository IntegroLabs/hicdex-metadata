{"__version": 1, "token_id": 694777, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "PERSUADE", "description": "For a long time, I thought that 'PERSUADE' is one of the most beautiful words in the English lexicon. It's soft sounding and rolls off the tongue so easily. I particularly love the way the \"S\" sound is used like a hinge to transfer syllabic power within the word: PERS-SUADE. When you say the word as if you're in slow motion, you hear two distinct words being pronounced: PURSE and SUEDE. Let's take these words and smash them together and see what happens. As the words come together, they begin to intertwine with each other mixing and mingling with other letters from the other word. This becomes a pattern that we repeat over and over again. The woven words appear become a rich syntax crystal tapestry. I could see this being it's own side project with many variations and colorways. This is an extremely rare occurrence within the English language. I'm sure other examples exist, but they remain illusive to me...for now.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdF7PvtVoLg6GCoUTvgvnGxy1bfDK5wx8NosXxDiMVopB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXdnwQdfqNHirr8s4ekG9sC4GLL5en5UX2inSD3UVqTap", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdF7PvtVoLg6GCoUTvgvnGxy1bfDK5wx8NosXxDiMVopB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

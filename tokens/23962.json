You don't have to have all the pieces to have the whole. In fact, you only need one piece to have the whole. What that means is, if consciousness is a holographic reality, then we don't need to have all the pieces of the puzzle to have the whole picture. That's why when we have a transcendent experience, we suddenly see the whole picture. We see the larger reality.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZequsTqVGSgXFudT4n4aDRvJbkCETakM517CEVdUx83i","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmZequsTqVGSgXFudT4n4aDRvJbkCETakM517CEVdUx83i"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmVLaTCGkUPq9hFdtBJgmNQ21uFgb8hhAKksq6VYXjsWZ6"},"supply":"25","transfered":60}

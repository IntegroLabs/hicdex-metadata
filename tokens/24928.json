Actually, being asleep is the job. There's snoring on the soundtrack as the dog's long, flat tongue flutters behind the broken-picket fence of its wet, white teeth. The video is an example of the \"malignant-benign\". The dog is napping (benign), but his mouth looks like a tunnel of death (malignant) at a carnival, accompanied by drool.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUmHPZdBQng1FkBRLTjfXSrvVCNr2w7DZHrStvCuUoPZQ","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmUmHPZdBQng1FkBRLTjfXSrvVCNr2w7DZHrStvCuUoPZQ"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmapNsxHeSV2UbrjbicRBUX6vNX6GsDfvCDizj5cY7NG1m"},"supply":"15","transfered":11}

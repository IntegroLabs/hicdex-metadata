God forbid our torturers","decimals":0,"description":"Brazil never lost its place as a colony. Today, it behaves like a flea of capital and ideology. The country tries to instill ideas of economic liberalism, worshiping the capitalist American model. The president praises the flag while Brazilians vomit insanity, asking God for forgiveness for torturers dressed in KKK. At the bottom, there is the slavery logic of the place: domination and the makeup of horror. Overlapping images and illustrations from current Brazil and the 16th century.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcoS9VDW37NKXxqm7J8EQ5sqZSsC43joybnLrkZCmzpZ9","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1fWvajFtE16eJbmE49MBNPGBLM4K7Zg9kt"],"tags":["politics","brasil","brazil","kkk","racism","hatred","violence","bolsonaro"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmcoS9VDW37NKXxqm7J8EQ5sqZSsC43joybnLrkZCmzpZ9"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmempfeBVcL9K7caEaE8hDASc2qKHVpMrmPUikqa5fcB2g"},"supply":"3","transfered":5}

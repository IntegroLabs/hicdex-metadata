You live in a crowded city, so you look up to notice the birds. They can fly away, yet they seem to stay. Stay in the same crowded city as you do.  You notice; the pigeons on the powerlines look like they are behind bars.  They seem to be stuck in place just like you. They can fly away to anywhere they wish, yet they choose to stay in your city. Just like you.

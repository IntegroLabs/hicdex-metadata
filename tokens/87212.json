Every pixel art piece will involve everyones favorite coin, which most certainly is Tezos. Great White sharks are one of my favorite animals. There's so much mystery surrounding their activity and they are so terrifying. Growing up in the 80's, me and my mom would sometimes visit Cape Cod for a day at the beach.

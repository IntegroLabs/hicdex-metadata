The 1968 LP originally featured photography by David Montgomery that Hendrix disliked. I loved this album so much when I was growing up. Remarkably parts of it still sound fresh (and futuristic) today. Whilst it features one of the greatest singles of all time, Crosstown Traffic, the real highlight is second side starting with Rainy Day, Dream Away. I would listen to it at bed time and fall Gently Gently Away.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSTMpPADi9T37K4bhpHAE5UWXrAtGCaNeVQJVMaPYdcFK","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1TeLXGCQYuJyeSJcbdynDP2nh8t1A7AocZ"],"tags":["jonburgerman","burgerman","jon","jimihendrix","music","record"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmSTMpPADi9T37K4bhpHAE5UWXrAtGCaNeVQJVMaPYdcFK"}],"supply":"1","transfered":1}

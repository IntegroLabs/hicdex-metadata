Every pixel art piece will involve everyones favorite coin, which most certainly is Tezos. I decided to rock some Tarantino inspired pixel art today, as he's one of my favorite directors and Reservoir Dogs is such a perfect film. As a late teen in the late 90's, I would stay up all night and watch Bravo. They would often play films like Reservoir Dogs, 400 Blows and many more.

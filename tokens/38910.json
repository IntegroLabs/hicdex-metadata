Follow me on tt and ig: @colapsismo.   For buyers, since H=N only allows 40MB, I can send you the original files. Contact me: gustavo.h.paim@gmail.com. This is the first of a series of droning loops i've been making. The sound aims to guide you to a meditative state of abstraction of sameness and perception of difference. At the end, the listener will notice that no parts of the piece sound the same.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVY4LqsKLMtkf1EXFwptiHv3c4pJPjMo2485Y3kFXs56H","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1SWFZDWJpVySdgTiYaVHeoiYGt8FqVxK7Q"],"tags":["audio","sound","soundart","tape","loop","musiqueconcrète","performance","audiocollage","generativemusic","drone","ambient","music","noise","guitar",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmVY4LqsKLMtkf1EXFwptiHv3c4pJPjMo2485Y3kFXs56H"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmUzskoUCrHw4QNCEVMKaPqPUjUJ6E9NmTZi3G5mktpXYN"},"supply":"11","transfered":21}

{"name": "\u2022  Existentialist Humanism  \u2022", "description": "The meaning of humanism means that man is continually outside himself; it is by projecting himself outside himself that he brings man into existence and, on the other hand, it is by pursuing transcendental ends that he can exist. There is no other universe than this human universe, the universe of human objectivity. This union of transcendence, as constitutive of man, not in the sense that God is transcendent, but in the sense of transcendence and subjectivity in the sense that man is not enclosed in himself but always present in a human universe, is what we call existentialist humanism. Humanism because we remind man that there is no other legislator than himself, and that it is in helplessness that he will decide about himself, and because we show that it is not by returning to himself but by seeking outside himself an end that is this or that liberation, this or that particular realization, that man will realize himself precisely as a human being.", "tags": ["0xLxxl", "Absurdism", "Thoughts"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmW33F8V5qL6zjd6kTS6JZrN14fysRcD2eHkxZiWRoTAHK", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmRN9f89RuiCViYTWyHNhaGtgXVAPzWvJxGnckAHJfwJXK", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1SGoKJAdNunz1pBZe1a1Et8icfHjXoSa9j"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW33F8V5qL6zjd6kTS6JZrN14fysRcD2eHkxZiWRoTAHK", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

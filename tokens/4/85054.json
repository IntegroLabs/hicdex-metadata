The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-deltoid type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots in the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a nonreversible tremmie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the \"up\" end of the grammeters.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaZDU1pMimBxhNXRsV73cwP84a9JXvmac9hJZaxehSdRK","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1X7g3cVm1kkoTp6d4cNKprZUC2e3cDC91x"],"tags":["BDVXP"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmaZDU1pMimBxhNXRsV73cwP84a9JXvmac9hJZaxehSdRK"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmSZnbJwD4umWpk5CwMVZeYQz9MiP1kG57ohZkMqNbm9Yp"},"supply":"69","transfered":58}

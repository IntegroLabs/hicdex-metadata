ALL TOGETHER IS SEPARATE.", "description": "Here's two sentences that are legitimately true about themselves and each other, but done in a way where the sentence length is exactly the same and there is zero waste of concept. Let's dive in and see if we can bring the truth the surface. The word SEPARATE is ALL TOGETHER in one word, meaning SEPARATE's letters are collectively all together. Now the second sentence has a different meaning. The words ALL TOGETHER are two separate words and thus SEPARATE from each other. So we have both sentences, both true, both referencing each other, and both are the same length. It's not often you see sentences like this and because of this rarity, it deserved to be highlighted and showcased.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYJ2UUUw5sjXLiQVsHYqGC2ui6RDNkwgkU4c8BdzUVxiN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX3a9JJ8ViVTUNSdREQKdLdEwNQAuu6Lz6b3PBrBB9cUr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYJ2UUUw5sjXLiQVsHYqGC2ui6RDNkwgkU4c8BdzUVxiN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

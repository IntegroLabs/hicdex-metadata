Those cloud points derived from 3D scanned spaces, objects and people from my daily life - 3D snapshots. The 3D scanning process is normally used to acquire the best possible data to recreate certain things or people in the 3D space. I am interested in the process itself, in the dancing around a space or a person in order to capture it or her, in the glitches and in the errors that occur.  The flaws of the scanning process become integral part of the piece.\n\nSometimes, part of the \u201coriginal\u201d reality can be guessed or glimpsed. But mostly the resulting images are cryptic, evocative, sometimes poetic, sometimes almost like an organism in itself. They seems to expand the world around us, reveal other forms of looking, feeling and being in the world. I believe they defy our perception and the idea of a stable, rigid reality.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfAdjgGHya4UEWUuzexHsPxHKriMmvLRtvtyDrCd2A289", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdFGCeNFVxT7CT9X4vnuoQ8XrV6XfTqo1XipxyN1dW72k", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfAdjgGHya4UEWUuzexHsPxHKriMmvLRtvtyDrCd2A289", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bqhA5Q2o9fRdToVwi6o7oeq9sBvjAmjjG"], "tags": ["abstract", "3dscan", "photography", "conceptual", "cloudpoint", "brazilianartist", "kikanicolela"], "extra": {}}

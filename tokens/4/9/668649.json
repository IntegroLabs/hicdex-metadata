Jan 28, 2022, 14:11\nThis photo was taken on a winter sunny day in Landungsbr\u00fccken, Hamburg. I was on my way to get my third vaccine dose when I saw this green monstrous figure grab a person with its hand. This figure turns out to be called REKKUSU and it lives underground within the sewers. REKKUSU is a mixture of a dinosaur and a lizard and it can swim swiftly with the help of its fins. It eats mostly fish but it gets angry because the sewers are being contaminated.\n \n---------------------------\nKURO means black in Japanese and SHIRO means white.\n\nKUROSHIRO is a series of black and white pictures with a doodle of sightings all around Germany. These pictures were all taken by a Google Pixel 5.\n\n2268 x 2268", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYw1CbB1w5B978PbdeL9yDTT7sEsXXaE7R6gt6UDDq3wP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYnMSxAFp1szwwMyzVPfhsve5BusjRAJJP1QDHD47HtBF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYw1CbB1w5B978PbdeL9yDTT7sEsXXaE7R6gt6UDDq3wP", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Amn89MtzAfX8mzUZfcUpQJqpa8uep7aQv"], "tags": ["illustraion", "doodle", "photography", "Hamburg", "Japanese", "blackandwhite", "shigarakii_"], "extra": {}}

Finally, you reached the end. You bloomed, bloomed to the fullest you felt. But life doesn’t stop there. Ahead of you is the next chapter. You look ahead, you see glitches that need fixes. You look back, now your bloom glitches. Something seems wrong. There’s always something. Because life isn’t about blooming, it’s a journey, to rot and grow on repeat. That’s the reality. A realisation that you’re always learning and failing, growing and improving. That will never stop. That’s the point of this life, it challenges you to be the best version of you in the end.","tags":["Abstract","Glitch","Rose","Architecture","ContemporaryArt","CleanNFT"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmZWSbRuoW5WdTxSUypp4d5RPTp5TUfpcGeiteroGi3n25"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZWSbRuoW5WdTxSUypp4d5RPTp5TUfpcGeiteroGi3n25","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Decided to have a conversation with myself before the awakening of the sun. What are my desires?...& what is my current flow of energy? Rather than anxiously overwhelming myself as usual...I decided to follow a familiar path with the eyes of excitement. I believe what we ask will manifest as long as we trust and truly truly believe in whole heartedly..but it's been hard to attain daily with all of the everything...until this moment. Will it appear again? How do I demand it's occurrence. All I could imagine is that I must continue to practice imagining. I will wait for flow or be conscious of how this feeling feels to bring more positive results...with positive & hopeful knowing from beginning to end.\nDigital abstraction created in photoshop + generate.\n11-05-2021\n\ninstagram: @fiasco9.0\ntwitter: @no5ay_", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTUCTg7NXXmLKi6Crx2fqF4JcNvRoApP4rMgeVdTUEgrj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUngKE3EiZF9EJcmoLueUJMCRjcEHdsAuJ1aeJiCqVJ8Y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTUCTg7NXXmLKi6Crx2fqF4JcNvRoApP4rMgeVdTUEgrj", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1axJqKbbuyJAVgF8fiRDyAJRP5zsj4SLHF"], "tags": ["digital", "art", "abstract", "abstraction", "abstractart", "digitalabstraction", "digitalabstract", "nftart", "nft", "hen", "dreaming", "color", ""], "extra": {}}

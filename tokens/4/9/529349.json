Our environment is a representation of ourselves.  the symbols respond to each other, complement, and also identify the people around them. In the Indonesian equivalent, 'banal' means something that is repetitive.  This repetition is a symptom of the birth of a symbol (apart from a positive and negative perspective) which becomes an additional identification (if not the only one) to identify a social - cultural - political situation of humans.  this is important to know to recognize humans in this age of industrialism.\n\nThis photo is a concrete symbol of humans being degraded from their social environment.  In the past, this place was full of the houses of the people who lived here.  but now it has been destroyed just because a handful of greedy humans.  This horror is a symbolic moral that today's human life is increasingly headed for destruction.  not only the destruction of morals, but the destruction of all human beings.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ7aWx1E1uHUTkqFEZ44EeVCqQKiBZh5buih64vWqMAb8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYHjzvsAwGmE1NEhnaRgPKSnp9nRi4RiJagtjU5MttaCZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ7aWx1E1uHUTkqFEZ44EeVCqQKiBZh5buih64vWqMAb8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz28f36EsUqgfUBVUvBq5KsmSWRqdrfD8mnC"], "tags": ["Arifansdr", "societybanal", "photography", "blacknwhite"], "extra": {}}

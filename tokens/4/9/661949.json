This is the 15th letter in The Cool Alphabet, X Is For X-Files. Running from 1993 \u2014 2002 X-Files may be solely responsible for my love for the paranormal. The show touched upon nearly every corner of of the unknown during a time in the 90's when there was nothing else like it on television. I'm not even sure what genre The X-Files would be considered but irregardless of its classification it had a major influence on my belief system regarding what is possible and what could exist in our world.

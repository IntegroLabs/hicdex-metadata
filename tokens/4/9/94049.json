Commonly named as Palo Santo, the Kielmeyera Coriacea tree is only present at the Cerrado Savannas in Brazil. Used by local communities for a variety of medicinal purposes, and is yet unexplored by the pharmaceutical industry. Palo Santo is a commonly used name given to plants that produce some kind of scent when set on fire. The scent is caused by the resin present in the wood. Its seeds are protected by a rigid, dry and lightweight material that extends around it creating a thin paper sheet like structure which is light enough to fluctuate on air. Whenever the tree is shaken due to impact or wind, the seeds can travel long distances.

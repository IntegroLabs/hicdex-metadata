Each work overlays looping, geometric 3D animations onto photos that the artist took hiking throughout the U.S. and Canada. Antlers WiFi was the first project that combined Rick\u2019s signature landscape-based video art with the blog-art he pioneered throughout the 2000s via his Net Art personas. Antlers WiFi was also Rick\u2019s first major project using 3D animation, which has since become his medium of choice. http://antlerswifi.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZE7zSm2vqQZ2ksC7KsjP8cACDmB7CQD19ZSFir2Jr6De", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZE7zSm2vqQZ2ksC7KsjP8cACDmB7CQD19ZSFir2Jr6De", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZE7zSm2vqQZ2ksC7KsjP8cACDmB7CQD19ZSFir2Jr6De", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1NLpREQxMWR412xyEPfQgFkzFEnDsff1XA"], "tags": ["ricksilva", "antlerswifi", "landscape", "animation"], "extra": {}}

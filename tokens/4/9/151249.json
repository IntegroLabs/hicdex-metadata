The west side of Paxos island is almost full of cliffs and rocks. A visitor can access with relative ease beatiful view points. One of those is called \"Anemotripes\". This photograph was taken during a fullmoon on calm starry night. Some clouds made their appearence and the click happened. Capturing the cliffs, the clouds, the sea and the stars felt great and looked even better. George Angelis 2021.

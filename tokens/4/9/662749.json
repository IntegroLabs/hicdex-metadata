But life is very strange. I am faced with so many threats that want to split this soul that has been given to me and tear my body apart that all I feel is gratitude for being able to breathe today. When I look at people living in other geographies, sometimes they are not even aware that they are breathing, they behave like they are immortal androids. They have achieved these with certain gains from the past. Here we go back to my first sentence, living is not that important.\n\n2022\n\nAn artwork by AViz l tw: @afterviz ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPjHf3pKHP1hXdn1Qknr3tLGP4JPkzZ4NLoSL4AxKrjSb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYtK1mucMKuwy8nzsqPj7xPsLkbg93KBn7cWz3WieNZM5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPjHf3pKHP1hXdn1Qknr3tLGP4JPkzZ4NLoSL4AxKrjSb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1chTuYmpMRnYCVa7ez6EC4kwboh8uT3fQ5"], "tags": ["digital", "illustration", "dark", "nft", "3d", "aviz", "queer", "monster"], "extra": {}}

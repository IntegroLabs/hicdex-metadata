It was a wakeup call reminding me that kids are people too. Here's her description of this piece: \"I've been really stressed lately. I feel like I'm drowning and I'm not sure when I get to catch my breath. I think it's because of remote school, not seeing my friends, and hearing about how so many people are not doing so great.

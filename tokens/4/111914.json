In her rise, the hope of returning to earth.  This land became our treasure today.  The cursed game eventually came to an end, We so quickly forget the value of things, Blind, as if everything was eternal.  We are coming home.\"  Cyril Rolando \u2013 Aquasixio x C\u00e9dric Rolando \u2013 Neoyume  Cyril\u2019s original artwork \u201cCalypso\u201d , 3D sculpted and painted by C\u00e9dric.  3D textured model, .glb file format.

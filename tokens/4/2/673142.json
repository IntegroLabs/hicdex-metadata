{"__version": 1, "token_id": 673142, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Undead", "description": "The undead are beings in mythology, legend, or fiction that are deceased but behave as if they were alive. A common example of an undead being is a\u00a0corpse\u00a0reanimated by\u00a0supernatural\u00a0forces, by the application of either the deceased's own\u00a0life force\u00a0or that of another being such as a\u00a0demon. The undead may be\u00a0incorporeal\u00a0or\u00a0corporeal. The undead are featured in the belief systems of most cultures, and appear in many works of\u00a0fantasy\u00a0and\u00a0horror fiction. The term is also occasionally used for putative non-supernatural cases of re-animation, from early experiments like\u00a0Robert E. Cornish's to future sciences such as chemical brain preservation and\u00a0cryonics.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRy7th1XnvJY1c2igrU8D8hK7nDUwaVdYVp5BojVzvurL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbYHNRA6Gf2EeoWfXmg2dtdmBQUts2FvBsW9UD8XDrLFf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRy7th1XnvJY1c2igrU8D8hK7nDUwaVdYVp5BojVzvurL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aDXYQjFbqqMW62ZENMLJMpPWazA2L9CEk"], "tags": ["Art", "Illustration", "Drawing", "Ink", "Dark"], "extra": {}}

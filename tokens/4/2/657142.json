The plant signifies beginnings, growth, eco friendliness, and the concept of nurturing what we love.\n\nAndr\u00e9s Senn is an artist and programmer from Argentina who has been minting NFTs since 2018. They have been making waves on HEN and FxHash as of recent and GatherArt is happy to have added their works to our collection.\n\n\"In 1994 I began to study traditional musical composition. In the late 90\u2019s I implemented the computer to compose electroacoustic music and sound art. In the early 2000s, I started experimenting with image editing software. Later I left music and sound art aside to enter more into the world of image and programming.\" - Andr\u00e9s Senn", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdfdzPjhivNpZJVTa4oA2QtmXdEwEvZgzDFNYaumiCBFP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdfdzPjhivNpZJVTa4oA2QtmXdEwEvZgzDFNYaumiCBFP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdfdzPjhivNpZJVTa4oA2QtmXdEwEvZgzDFNYaumiCBFP", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YEYsb7nCUZXvVmGe3KDUECc7TR8DE8QUd"], "tags": ["gather", "gatherart", "plant", "noise", "bandw", "b&w", "blackandwhite", "nature", "tezos", "cleanNFT", "andressenn", "andres", "argentina"], "extra": {}}

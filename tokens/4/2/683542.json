An interlude is some kind of improvisation that musicians played before in between music parts. The amount of tension that this moment brings can be very imposing. A choreography was born out of this concept which are the base for these 3D sculptures. These 3D captures in space were first hand drawn on canvas and later digitalized as lines. Each line shows the movement of the hand or foot of the dancer who\u2019s performing the choreography. The movements are each separated to zoom in on the improvisation of the body. If you would combine the 4 lines of every hand and foot together, a graphical notation of a dance will form itself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ4B6AeT2Jha9uCXsT6BoMEjHAP43Dp43BkGpZdwhgi7Q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR2ZHSMGo33rga9WDAa2tgayyB2Trhxpha8mWMMzK2Km3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ4B6AeT2Jha9uCXsT6BoMEjHAP43Dp43BkGpZdwhgi7Q", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1cs32ydPhm3Vk7vv6TBbbKKJYiG9NBcDo1"], "tags": ["3D", "Choreography", "Intermezzo", "Interlude", "Illustration", "3DSculpture", "Line"], "extra": {}}

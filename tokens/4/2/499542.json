His technique is nothing short of innovative, producing fantastic skin like textured effects, revealing the beauty of objects, spaces and landscapes. He pursues an integrated method of painting expression to set figures, exploring historical fields and placing them in settings which appear to be separated by a certain time and space in a way that is simple and yet profound.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTiW6K4nnkzaZGWwp8p5RvzGDge8R1WyzUQNypJasfuPW", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdri3QC87N9qbh8pjRdtGSNGaUXHYv5xHiCmCBK1GPDTb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTiW6K4nnkzaZGWwp8p5RvzGDge8R1WyzUQNypJasfuPW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Xd51UAP5mqc5ZH8VEYHCrFqz3yj74r9hF"], "tags": ["watercoloroncloth", "watercolouroncloth", "watercolor", "watercolour", "nostalgia", "innovative", "painting", "cloth"], "extra": {}}

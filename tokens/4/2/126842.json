If you would like this free Hicetnunc OBJKT, simply follow me on Showtime (tryshowtime.com/jimmytheghost).  I\u2019ll be checking my followers regularly and any time I see a new one I\u2019ll send this piece to the Tezos Wallet ID listed in the Showtime profile of my new follower. This piece was created from 50 constantly rotating blocks with electric color sprites from the entire color spectrum pulsing between each block. The 50 blocks represent the individual people who will eventually own this piece and the new colorful art we will all be bringing into each other\u2019s lives by simply connecting through Showtime. Feel free to swap or burn. Enjoy!

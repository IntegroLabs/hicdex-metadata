Conflict affects all genders of the society but women are at a greater risk of facing physical and sexual abuse. \n\n\u201cIn essence, women's participation in mediation is simply a question of equality and fairness. Women make up half of a community. Their voices should be heard.\u201d - Hanna Tetteh, UN Under Secretary General, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nThis artwork aims to highlight the vital role that women play in the society in conflict solving, mediating peace and gender equality. The pairing with ravens is due to its complex symbolism in literature and world lore, as well as a nod to a French anthropologist, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019 structuralist theory that suggests the raven obtained mythic status because it was a mediator animal between life and death.\n\nIllustration by LakarUmbi.\nAudio and animation by Tingkah-Lagu.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbthtLnXnDb1xGVbZiJ5TWCXwe4QtffYTzHg9XtnaEav1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVxJdJCC22JNoarExq8pVZ5G5ad3Gn3bvTahtqHbcJJhj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbthtLnXnDb1xGVbZiJ5TWCXwe4QtffYTzHg9XtnaEav1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QHYQ19QqY7pUUPWZMjBRpy8VmoH3Qq4zK"], "tags": ["illustration", "animation", "audio", "women", "equality"], "extra": {}}

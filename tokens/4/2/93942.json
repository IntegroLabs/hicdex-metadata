In these baskets, people-stumps sat for an hours (sometimes they were hung from the thick branches of trees, in the manner of huge nests), breathed fresh air. But sometimes the air on the northern island in the evening became too fresh, and the nannies, busy with other things, did not react to the calls for help. It happened, and they completely forgot to remove any of the \"nests\" for the night and return their inhabitants to the living quarters, then the case could end even with death from hypothermia.","tags":["voxel","voxelart"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmYfKJcgreyUvAwHcv8NU6rFZwd33829cWpjRyoAogr5LE"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYfKJcgreyUvAwHcv8NU6rFZwd33829cWpjRyoAogr5LE","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

And exactly when he feels the least his mind to war must go.\"  The strength inside that takes over when we feel defeated is my Muse. My fuel to create, my will to see that next horizon.  I have created these Passing Kings and Warriors for as long as I can remember and strongly believe that each one I bring to life will stand to defend me when I inevitably join them. I wish you the same.","tags":["passingking","skull","skeleton","horsemen","apocalypse",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmbh8RjvSuX5RNsojkmyjZ15maskHytqZRyvzQqHybm9VB"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmbh8RjvSuX5RNsojkmyjZ15maskHytqZRyvzQqHybm9VB","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

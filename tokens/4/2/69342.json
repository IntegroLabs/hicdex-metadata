And exactly when he feels the least his mind to war must go.\"  The strength inside that takes over when we feel defeated is my Muse. My fuel to create, my will to see that next horizon.

I wish you the same.","tags":["passingking","skull","skeleton","horsemen","apocalypse",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmbh8RjvSuX5RNsojkmyjZ15maskHytqZRyvzQqHybm9VB"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmbh8RjvSuX5RNsojkmyjZ15maskHytqZRyvzQqHybm9VB","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTXyHVMAXCeFMzkjpw1XkVLgRFZSfyBQ1tQviqSvbouWs","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

It is a stimulant drug that speeds up the messages traveling between the brain and body. Tar and carbon monoxide (a toxic gas) are also released when tobacco is burned, such as when it\u2019s smoked. The products such as cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and wet and dry snuff, and the dried leaves from the tobacco plant all contain nicotine. Chewing or snorting tobacco products usually releases more nicotine into the body than smoking. Nicotine is at least as difficult to give up as heroin. The side effects of nicotine can affect the heart, hormones, and gastrointestinal system. Some studies suggest that nicotine may improve memory and concentration. There are more than one billion tobacco smokers worldwide.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfF3xevATeufDhekyAHfURiEDmgDJ7nXwG6aGVa3Nco5r", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfF3xevATeufDhekyAHfURiEDmgDJ7nXwG6aGVa3Nco5r", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfF3xevATeufDhekyAHfURiEDmgDJ7nXwG6aGVa3Nco5r", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "drugs", "nft", "collectible", "nicotine"], "extra": {}}

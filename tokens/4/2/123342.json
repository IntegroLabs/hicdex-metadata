{"name": "DareNotSpeakItsName_ARTIFACT_09:perverse", "description": "In recognition of Gay Pride, and of my start with digital art, I  have reawakened some of my early work as my first NFTs. The series includes artifacts from my 1995 interactive animated dynamic collage, DareNotSpeakItsName. Each jpg is a screen capture of a moment of user engagement with the artwork. Composed from my photographs and video, as well as appropriated images, texts, sound, and dialogue from \"The Wizard of Oz\", gay porn videos, and news articles, DareNotSpeakItsName explored the relationship between mass-media representation, identity, imagination, and viewership as mechanisms of the closet.", "tags": ["#artylikeits1995#nft", "#nftart", "#gay", "#gayartist", "#gaypride", "#queer", "#queerart", "#pixelart", "#pixel", "#pixelated", "#8bit", "#collage", "#pixelartwork"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmRCRjtt6bLeG8wnP92QjnKWHKAmcGX68VWPdPtQfv9XhV", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmWFm3kYV2wXPZyqrCmnm8VYhKirVwUierJuX9vFbttoue", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1VbbqpW2Lh9aM7yyji9y1QkhQeDi7i3EQd"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRCRjtt6bLeG8wnP92QjnKWHKAmcGX68VWPdPtQfv9XhV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

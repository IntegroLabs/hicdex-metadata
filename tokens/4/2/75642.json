Most of the dream was a classic run from the monster type of thing. Then towards the end (seemed like weeks later) it was decided the only solution was to introduce it to an AI. They unexpectedly fell in love and the demon was placated. Upon waking up, quite disturbed still, i drew this picture so i would remember the dream.

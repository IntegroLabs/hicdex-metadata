Now, half a century later, as I share these in a digital marketplace full of artists hawking their wares, I hope these photos remind us all of the humanity behind the transactions. This photo was taken circa 1970 in what I knew then as Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka—one of my favorite places on my travels.","tags":["photo","photography","vietnam","ceylon","srilanka","1970"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmRk1kYsuc3SzqDVLbFkEoxRQSjRGV5fBSP8Ko7Xq5tXUA"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRk1kYsuc3SzqDVLbFkEoxRQSjRGV5fBSP8Ko7Xq5tXUA","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTGzhbgVhnMh3uFc7APQjpVnabhX5ojcVYNtfwazon3m7","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

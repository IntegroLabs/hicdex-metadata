It is in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, France. It was commissioned by Jean-Baptiste Faure. Degas temporarily abandoned work on this painting, and delivered a work of a similar name to Faure.\nThe painting depicts dancers at the end of a lesson under ballet master Jules Perrot. Perrot and Degas were friends, and Degas painted the dance class in the Paris Opera a year after it burnt down.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUzXMrYWFhMydTfHWqKoYkFxZG6SBDQJXyScfhqzV2N1f", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVcJ5kbhBDS2NJV6Dx2714f7xXLbs8eYZdnpLH7q6CKoM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUzXMrYWFhMydTfHWqKoYkFxZG6SBDQJXyScfhqzV2N1f", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz2L8LMuCTipzj35q8ETsF1fPnVqokR1KzrM"], "tags": ["Repaint", "Impressionism", "interactive", "html", "creative", "TheBalletClass", "LaClassededanse"], "extra": {}}

It has marshmallow frosting, chocolate ganache, chocolate cake layers, and a ginger-flavored cake layer too, to pack that graham cracker punch. Toasted coconut adds a nice smoky crunchiness to go with a warm  crackling bonfire. Devour it with your best friends in the springtime dusk, telling dark stories.","tags":["cake","food","cute","kawaii","3D","marshmallow","chocolate"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmWPCqyskeBCtpb3gVYUZkFANLr6T6HsCYVpDKyw2YQvFk"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWPCqyskeBCtpb3gVYUZkFANLr6T6HsCYVpDKyw2YQvFk","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

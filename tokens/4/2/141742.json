These states are sufficiently different for the possibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking, there are no such machines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine which can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch must be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most purposes we can forget about them.' \u2014\u2009Alan Turing 1950", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUvxuJbpyrwpyn9q5RzeSefd4eCuweH5PjGRT7TNGVpHM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUvxuJbpyrwpyn9q5RzeSefd4eCuweH5PjGRT7TNGVpHM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUvxuJbpyrwpyn9q5RzeSefd4eCuweH5PjGRT7TNGVpHM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1UtxzH6nteEYDgJHrU6zVUKRSfsac1JEMx"], "tags": ["HENTHOUSAND", "GAN", "DIGITALART", "FUTURE", "DIGITAL", "VR", "ENCRYPTION", "NFT"], "extra": {}}

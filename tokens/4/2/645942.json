Consider this my version of Descartes' \"I think, there for I am.\" statement, with a contemporary twist. Having the ability to say, \"I AM\", gives us agency to debate. Debate? Debate about what? The ability to debate what consciousness is and is not. By saying, \"I AM; BAM\", we're clearly making a declarative statement that we indeed are here and with such an impact (physical, mental, spiritual, etc.) that it creates an almost onomatopoeia like entrance. We are conscious beings born of fire from the stars and deep from within the trenches of oceans; we are alive; we are here and we are all unique like snowflakes falling from the sky into a bitter winter night's maelstrom.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXhxFLYb3PBBCYmPuXFr36mNigaCHBEGfupBjtZmP5F2q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXaUA74vP69EnFiVv8EnTEkm8ZtdqcEn6GDsk7yBoeZyY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXhxFLYb3PBBCYmPuXFr36mNigaCHBEGfupBjtZmP5F2q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

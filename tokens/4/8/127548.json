Jester is aptly named to match their personality. They enjoy being on the giving end of light hearted pranks and keep away games. Their favorite games so far are \"hide the celphone\" and \"I ate all your left shoes\". We would advise not returning the favor as this has been known in escalating their efforts, Jester isnt one to be shown up.  Seriously.. people have gone missing.

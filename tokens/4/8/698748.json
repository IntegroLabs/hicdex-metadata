{"__version": 1, "token_id": 698748, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Deaht Skull", "description": "Death is the inevitable, permanent, irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism.[1] Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death.[2] The remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death. Death is an inevitable, universal process that eventually occurs in all organisms.\n\nDeath is generally applied to whole organisms; the similar process seen in individual components of an organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis. Something that is not considered an organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed but is not said to die. As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day, with ageing being by far the most common cause of death.\n\nMany cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also may hold the idea of judgement of good and bad deeds in one's life (Heaven, Hell, Karma).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVvHCDEYnLcKNJMDM7gZZTi8nnSbrrh9dWHiACRSKfNKR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZBD2JWxKX7HmE8P9mn8uHpQrw6k4uZ2Q9cTvUNZieDzU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVvHCDEYnLcKNJMDM7gZZTi8nnSbrrh9dWHiACRSKfNKR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cG6833gShVVLy8kAD9JMyLaqtpf8J9DB5"], "tags": ["DeathLOve", "skull", "skeleton", "art", "skull"], "extra": {}}

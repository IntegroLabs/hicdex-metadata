It is an attempt to create an escalating visual memory that monumentalizes continuous events.

While inside, visitors can empathise with the events that are still happening, immersing themselves in an audio-visual meditation. When the data update will stop n-Cave will enter its death phaseâ€”it will freeze, keeping a snapshot of its structure as both a virtual space and a physical monument.","tags":["xr","architecture","covid-19","meditation"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"model/gltf-binary","uri":"ipfs://QmQ9U3DGxneVSQffsV5adBYrShyT4E8C8ppH1418GDCxny"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQ9U3DGxneVSQffsV5adBYrShyT4E8C8ppH1418GDCxny","display_uri":"ipfs://QmX6A7RMvsxCdnSBpJ3viQDaZE2yD5xL29uiyy5Z52JprJ","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

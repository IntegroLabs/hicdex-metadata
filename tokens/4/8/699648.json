I'd never consider myself a Graf artist but I'm heavily influenced by street art AND the entirety of my custom toy career I've painted my custom pieces using aerosol cans...so I have ALOT of them around my studio. There is something about seeing a rack of cans that represents endless possibility. In the right place and the right hands this liquid rainbow could be transformed into a masterpiece. Watching an expert using a can is something to be in awe of and makes me want to be better at my own craft. They say it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert in something, which is 416 consecutive days, and realistically you might have time to become an expert in 2 or 3 things in a single lifetime. And though we may want to be good at alot of things, being an expert in a few of them may be an even more lofty goal as a creator.

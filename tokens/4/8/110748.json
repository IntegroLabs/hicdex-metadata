It is a statement on generative variants that can be easily created by changing a few variables in generative art. Being a generative artist myself I felt that I should find out what would it take to create large number of variants “de-generatively”. All of the autos are hand painted works on paper, scanned and digitised. Each of the 45 autos is an automatic drawing and hence carries a portion or a signature of my subconscious.","tags":["generative","degenerative","illustration"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmPX5zLXVBavUpBP2Gajj4BrbKi1Fc9f7gnhQQi5JREGUm"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPX5zLXVBavUpBP2Gajj4BrbKi1Fc9f7gnhQQi5JREGUm","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVimnpiu6Nf6cfbDHtZidZDew1quwmjgTwRP9Y83Z5YLV","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

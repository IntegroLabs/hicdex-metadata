I have no idea who she is or where she came from, she just suddenly popped up one day and became our number one customer who we don\u2019t even know her name.\n\n\nMy manager tells me never to ask questions to our customers but I really gotta ask her why she keeps coming back here or what exactly she\u2019s doing with those cans of spray paint, but she\u2019s been doing it every day for the past year and a half now. We also don\u2019t live in any major city where graffiti is an issue, no we live in a cozy little suburb\u2026 so\u2026 what on earth is she buying all of our spray paint for?\n\n\u2014-\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied. White frames are initially only given out via giveaways. All artworks will be compatible within the Gallery Gehenna Game with each artwork unlocking a playable story segment.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcDUn87RdYnhMcgnHvPVFBcuDqo8DHVcwtSViw1kCgKis", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcDUn87RdYnhMcgnHvPVFBcuDqo8DHVcwtSViw1kCgKis", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcDUn87RdYnhMcgnHvPVFBcuDqo8DHVcwtSViw1kCgKis", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2KTcdaM1hm8d8K9pnBu6dsD6v38bjyXDAP"], "tags": ["Neuralart", "neural", "art", "artist", "anime", "animegirl", "artistgirl", "experimental", "neuralnetwork", "gallerygehenna", "gallerygehennaproject", "mixedmedia", "whiteframe"], "extra": {}}

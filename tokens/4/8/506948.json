The dramatic scribbles, some darker and some lighter, some disjoint and others continuous, captures the frantic and chaotic lives we lead as we work through a global pandemic, a global movement against worker exploitation, and an economy and ecology that are both teetering on the edge of collapse. \"Distraction at a Restaurant\" evokes this in ink alongside grease on the back side of a restaurant receipt as a form of social commentary on the ways we hide the messy and dirty parts of our existence behind a public face that exudes \"normalcy.\" And what could be more normal than an evening out, dining at a restaurant? The receipt is pierced through the center, a literal hole in place of the metaphorical hole that is often the only connecting thread between our public and private lives.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNRQRTGPqz5pXDnCXBk9nf3bz7NwWHwqj7Gi55GCkXnfb", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma5HeK97gP9e3CjR8jjbmscVdPWEtfeu6ZPjsgacX9kMf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNRQRTGPqz5pXDnCXBk9nf3bz7NwWHwqj7Gi55GCkXnfb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lr3MZdQWMJsi8jSQP1JtMX8G8r6CqL7cE"], "tags": ["daughter", "daughters", "creation", "creations"], "extra": {}}

A cosmic entity is an abstract concept that refers to the universe or cosmos as a whole. This could be interpreted as a single, all-encompassing entity, or as a multitude of entities that together make up the cosmos. The artworks in this collection explore different aspects of the cosmic entity concept. Some pieces focus on the vastness and grandeur of the cosmos, while others explore the idea of the cosmos as a living, breathing entity. All of the artworks in this collection strive to evoke a sense of awe and wonder at the vast, mysterious universe.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTzpn7b885Fsm4VFYbM6xoQjHKSYh3fiYAair649aQN2j", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTJ8KZ26ZB1Qg9X599nnkArnztsDySWUwTEzkxcJEshYZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTzpn7b885Fsm4VFYbM6xoQjHKSYh3fiYAair649aQN2j", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NjfgYuTiuTCuUUhsLZvnMKaThj9yroQ54"], "tags": ["aiart", "gan", "cyberpunk", "color", "galaxy", "cosmic", "fantasy", "digitalart", "illustration", "2d", "artificialintelligence", "ai"], "extra": {}}

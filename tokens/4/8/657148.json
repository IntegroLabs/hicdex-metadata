This one is especially rare as the word itself defines the actions that are being taken within the words themselves; quite meta if you ask me. We start with the word REDUCED and each line down we reduce REDUCED to a simpler form be pulling out certain letters but still retaining the integrity of phonetical sound of the word. REDUCED becomes REDUCD, then RDUCD, etc. As we get towards the bottom the word becomes more and more filtered to its essentials. We've reduced REDUCED to just an \"R\", which is as far as you can go with this word. Minimalism always wins in my book.

Values and edges blend more than you think. There are NO straight lines. Simplify shapes and block them out. Faces curve a lot.\n\n\ud83e\uddec\ud83e\uddbd\ud83e\udd2f\ud83c\udfeb - 28/11/2020 | \ud83d\ude98\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f\ud83d\udc57\ud83d\udc1d - 29/11/2020 | \ud83d\udc50\ud83d\ude46\ud83c\udf31\ud83e\udd8b - 30/11/2020\n\nFeel free to take a layers-of-depth/figure approach.

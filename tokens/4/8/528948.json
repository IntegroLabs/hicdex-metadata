He was identified with Irra, the god of scorched earth and war, and with Meslamtaea, He Who Comes Forth from Meslam. Cuthah (modern Tall Ibr\u0101h\u012bm) was the chief centre of his cult. In later thought he was a \u201cdestroying flame\u201d and had the epithet sharrapu (\u201cburner\u201d). Assyrian documents of the 1st millennium BC describe him as a benefactor of men, who hears prayers, restores the dead to life, and protects agriculture and flocks. Hymns depict him as a god of pestilence, hunger, and devastation.\" - Britannica", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaKMhHq2sy45VCu6g4vFGqBABn4D7phiihprHCBANLaoi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYPYRCcvj3yxf8hWwA7cWx94HJA7S9B6ETrhVV9aogHo4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaKMhHq2sy45VCu6g4vFGqBABn4D7phiihprHCBANLaoi", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WXSHz8TekNBDDtogEWnLxHsbRfDJzgjBW"], "tags": ["plague", "disease", "pestilence", "mythology", "gods", "animated", "video", "infection"], "extra": {}}

On one hand, it is totally legitimate to manifest our identity, sometimes even to change it. On the other hand, emphasizing own identity can make division between us and others stronger: golden garden fences refer to possible walls between people. This makes caring for one another in a society more difficult (notice the distortion of the spoken words). The figure in the background seems to be disabled, still it has signs of prizes tatooed on its body. Through buying this artwork you support the artist. Identity saves and condemns us at the same time?","tags":["NikolasMÃ¼ller","3D","rendering","KHM","alpha","cis-man","disabled","queer","artist","normativ","functional","identity","choose2","discourse","gaybe","art","contemporaryart","newmediaart","videoart",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmZSxbALPtmW18jNNp829nEpjs8Bu3eVUedwFpykv46LQu"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZSxbALPtmW18jNNp829nEpjs8Bu3eVUedwFpykv46LQu","display_uri":"ipfs://QmaHvHgm1tbSsBHKSXG93XhtDzsVYTQcZHRfocKEG5yNkd","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

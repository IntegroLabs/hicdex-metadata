The oak obscures and almost swallows the sun. At the same time, its branches are enveloped in yellow sunlight. The oak is crooked, some branches bear no leaves. It is old and yet it stands in the open.\nIn the background, a forest edge can be seen, interrupted to allow the view further into the distance, perhaps the sea. The sky is overcast, cloud formations stand out.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaUadn8xGCCPKbUkcoEoXFZhoCYkGF2sENv7xGkLMMmqK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSrY8Roe6wy4AAVamfxWLkj5rGQ6vqjz6NdcPjXjsMtiz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaUadn8xGCCPKbUkcoEoXFZhoCYkGF2sENv7xGkLMMmqK", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1RQRZEToscP9yRde16XoJZubtq4fLFyyWm"], "tags": ["painting", "landscape", "oak", "tree"], "extra": {}}

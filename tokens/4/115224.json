The writing, axis of this series, designed from scratch and detached from any previously existing language, proposes to the viewer experiences in which the presence of \"texts\" is perceived, and the interrogation for the potential meaning expressed. Given that any reader completes the meaning of what he reads, I seek to enhance the situation of \"projected meaning\", given that by design (and if you like, by tenacity), this writing lacks intrinsic meaning, whatever emerges from confronting its texts will be, for all practical purposes, the creation of the viewer. I program the masters pieces of this series as real time installations, sometimes interactive, other purely generative.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ3R5ZLF3KJAfCrmwg5MD5nX93jgGLZKq1id3KtFbGRrr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUFcwhQZQAPrUWzzvnBjTrS1amdboGBxRwYCcwqU9PcuE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1VhEgoZQ5GUFpEh2jFvZ4pjuohjXP73bHT"], "tags": ["generative", "asemic", "writing", "written", "text", "written", "monocharacter", "creativecoding", "algorithmic", "3D", "3Dmodel", "twisted", "3Dobject", "3DOBJKT", "OBJKT", "hicetnunc", "tezos", "blender", "processing", "partsofvoid", "partesdelvacio", "series", "gltf", "glb"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "model/gltf-binary", "uri": "ipfs://QmZ3R5ZLF3KJAfCrmwg5MD5nX93jgGLZKq1id3KtFbGRrr"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmeLz3p88kjCXwge7wWeLy51gonDzmgqbJmsVJdUhKYDDz"}, "supply": "50"}

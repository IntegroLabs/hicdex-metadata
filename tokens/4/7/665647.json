After noticing that a fellow researcher from CAN named PHOSPHOR OPERATOR started perceiving a lot of eerie movements on his setup, the things got deeper and deeper... He lost all control of his rig and then, suddenly, a transmission starts, at the same time that happens on our MGK-TV on the research laboratory... We managed to sync our movement in both countries and record that unprecedented event. MGK-TV learned to sing a new song... that clings to our minds... putting pressure on our necks... It started spreading its neural network, looking for other labs to perpetuate its message, whatever its intentions are at this point...", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcZNhM3pec3uTAqoAJaAwCFeCPUdNc8tsHQK6iTtW466t", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYEg86YZHYD6h6JLV7jGmTbQX2LRd9nZ4uZTYNxxN66uU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcZNhM3pec3uTAqoAJaAwCFeCPUdNc8tsHQK6iTtW466t", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["KT1S1uh6ypMw9fSRdqD6W6amXS2HNjsg5Dgz"], "tags": ["thee\u2013overseer", "phosphoroperator", "electrostatic", "mgk-frequencies", "mgk-television", "arg", "transmission", "27251"], "extra": {}}

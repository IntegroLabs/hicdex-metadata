{"__version": 1, "token_id": 652247, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Kristina Sheli - Induratize (Offical Music Video) [4P001, 4PAWS Records]", "description": "\u201cInduratize\u201d is a one-take song about a typically disordered, modern times relationship. It\u2019s a picture of long-time dumbed feelings and confused personalities bound in useless fights and wasted emotions. It portraits two people who neither accept nor respect the other\u2019s beliefs and decisions. It's about a hardened heart, resistant to the original idea of love.\n\nThe song features a heavy threaded groove, a mystical combo of dark synth lines and clean, icy vocals. The lyrics are written unconventionally, frameless, genderless and abstract, in\u00a0Kristina Sheli\u2019s characteristic style. \u201cInduratize\u201d is the first independent release on 4PAWS Records (Cat. No. 4P-001). \n\nWritten-by: Kristina Sheli\nArtwork & Design-by: Sasha Scherdin\nExecutive Producer:\u00a0Rob Lange\n\n4PAWS Records", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVM8zS2cB6dzRH9uYcNpJdoZqxVAo5UAE9V6SBBeNbG98", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbfHWoz4Bh1FEDx2FSMq1mHxbeSdBGonyYKLdH8vPHsX1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVM8zS2cB6dzRH9uYcNpJdoZqxVAo5UAE9V6SBBeNbG98", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RVtCW1YbVkjeWwEhz8jGtfLVhZzyytB5g"], "tags": ["music", "musicvideo", "4pawsrecords", "kristinasheli", "downtempo", "soul", "soulmusic", "nftmusic", "love", "induratize"], "extra": {}}

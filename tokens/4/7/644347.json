She deserves a better passing. \nSo I decide to give her one. \nAn alternate ending where she was not a trophy. \nWhere she could choose her own way to die, \npetrified and welcoming a better ending :')", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVFSSZjg4iRPJahbTY4bczMJLBGuHAhb5HEwrX1asUPud", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSxqkfvYP14eGutCZHDi7EVNqRAKkpymCWBbdThxsSkge", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVFSSZjg4iRPJahbTY4bczMJLBGuHAhb5HEwrX1asUPud", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MyDGjmfeNM893PMncuCEfezG9vMcyywda"], "tags": ["nftcollector", "nftartist", "adventure", "illustration", "nftart", "cleannft", "nft", "digitalillustration", "bizarre", "myth", "greekmyth", "monster", "crypt", "Medusa", "death", "dead", "betterending", "stone", "statue"], "extra": {}}

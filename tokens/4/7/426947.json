Bad moments in my life helped me find interesting stories.\nSo I found a lot of new friends and they inspired me so much. \nMy equipment was broken but not my mask and never my imagination. Bunny was always on my back for 2 years.\n\nMusic by: Zhan Davids", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcFkj2ccY4QC4KnpVPGtke7D5VDZCSCpG9s4EbcXmSTuf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmatiavxYmUMgn5C2j15UMRqukQzFf7XuFQACSXHf7wPQD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcFkj2ccY4QC4KnpVPGtke7D5VDZCSCpG9s4EbcXmSTuf", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YjDz9w825kSAJVBNV5SJ4Dt5CK5RU9dCf"], "tags": ["FOOXEA", "video", ""], "extra": {}}

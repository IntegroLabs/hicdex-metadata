Well, it's a good thing DEAM is a real word...(wait what's that judges? You've deemed that deam isn't a valid word? It's only deem and not deam?) As much as this is true, there are some slang terms out there that use DEAM as a word. I almost exclusively use Websters or Wikipedia to ensure certain words are valid, but sometimes...sometimes folks I like to take a walk on the wild side and use slang. (Which a slang acronym spells out: Drop Everything And Masterbate) (Gasp, oh the hue-manity.) Does this produce a valid narrative or just unadulterated balderdash? I would say a little of both.

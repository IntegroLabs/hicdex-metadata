Paulo (available to read at http://almanaque.folha.uol.com.br/racismocordial.htm), published 25 June 1995. This Art Deco inspired profile was created with Macromedia FreeHand (then a standard issue drawing package) running on a Macintosh Quadra 950 with System 7.1. The drawing was created in a hurry to replace rejected proposals for a photographic cover and it ended up so successful that it was reused in the corresponding book cover, although unauthorized, uncredited and unpaid. Worse yet, the report won the newspaper's prestigious annual internal award. Due to a lapse by the editor, I was not entered in the contributor's list, even having my real name printed in the original cover. I appealled for a credit amendment and was ignored. This affair prompted me to quit the newspaper and migrate to magazine publishing, where I worked successfully for the ensuing 18 years.","tags":["illustration","vector","newspaper","racism","artdeco"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmTtExebGkeNPcsZk58cQGkymsk2Mpp4weWkej8cH4nPhq"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTtExebGkeNPcsZk58cQGkymsk2Mpp4weWkej8cH4nPhq","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdiGUamQPhimZTDHME9AA5EyvB77se7BpWjj1PeF87d9X","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

The World has been facing huge inhuman actions towards refugees, immigrants and people of color for far too long. Generations and generations of amazing people have been standing together to bring a voice and generate change.  This artwork is a memento made for any human who donates to the Border Kindness organization during the Showcase for a Cause event on 5.20.22. Border Kindness helps asylum-seekers, migrants, refugees, and the displaced with comprehensive services that include food, shelter, clothing, medical care and legal services. Let this be your contribution to making change for people in need.","tags":["Mexico","USA","history","organization","border","kindness","donor","donation","fundraiser","memento","global","cause","humanity","united"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmQGRrZHRH2tknGWYizvn167zHjJtTrwBMJYY3cj54bQgR"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQGRrZHRH2tknGWYizvn167zHjJtTrwBMJYY3cj54bQgR","display_uri":"ipfs://QmUFXECsLGEvamTY146NgNaMQmGUJ6xctzKf1BSvxmjTL4","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 663747, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LOS CIELOS / SOLLOCEIS", "description": "Spanish anagrams exist too though it's sometimes a bit more difficult to construct them. LOS CIELOS means 'the clouds' in Spanish. SOLLOCEIS comes from the verb Sollozar - to weep or sob. This form of the verb is a subjunctive 'vosotros' (old school informal 2nd person only used in some Latin American countries) conjugation, meaning a subjective, doubtful, or describing hypothetical non-real events. Ok, wow that was a lot of information in just a few sentences. So now how do we extract a narrative out of this or some sort of meaning, if any? Well, for one we look at the definitions and hold them side-by-side: clouds and a form of the verb to sob. Let's put them together into a framework, context, or space where they can make sense. We notice that the top word is LOS CIELOS (the clouds). The lines connecting to it's anagram SOLLOCEIS (you sob) act like rain falling from the clouds. Clouds create rain that cleanse of the skies. Sobbing is an act of convulsively crying and crying allows the soul to cleanse. In this scenario we can associate our souls with the clouds and raining with sobbing. Our minds are programmed to find the narrative in everything. Everything has a story to it because in our minds we're making all the stories up.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb5jFMhXVLFEfQaM1JtmmgjxY2CdAj6oisrjkS5uHNciC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRWuykPphALzDTQEGawUFjLufvF4j6V86SvbuGkQzDPZb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb5jFMhXVLFEfQaM1JtmmgjxY2CdAj6oisrjkS5uHNciC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

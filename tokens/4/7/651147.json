{"__version": 1, "token_id": 651147, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Rosetta Stoned", "description": "\"Rosetta Stoned\" is a song by the American progressive metal band Tool.\nThe name of the song is a reference to the Rosetta Stone.\nThe Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele inscribed with three versions of a decree issued in Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King Ptolemy V Epiphanes.\nThe top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. The decree has only minor differences between the three versions, making the Rosetta Stone key to deciphering the Egyptian scripts.\nLyrically, the song deals with a man's encounter with aliens, spiritual realizations, and his state of a coma after a DMT trip.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPYu2SWUvr5okpbof1gUHpezDzX48ZUNP37Ktp4sXvjtD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX8YUiYT4Cm4xmNkoTjKxcQ4PxTJUkgJmvCDMxvRxfiNg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPYu2SWUvr5okpbof1gUHpezDzX48ZUNP37Ktp4sXvjtD", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Zrzs1sC9BHbRwtDgFrNC4fkZ5cXMw83ch"], "tags": ["codeart", "generativeart", "UFO", "alien", "minimalart", "abstract", "math", "random", "mathart", "psychedelic", "minimal", "nft", "cleannft", "nftcollector", "python"], "extra": {}}

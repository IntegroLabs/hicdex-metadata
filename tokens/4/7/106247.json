One week, an apartment balcony and a camera. This series of photos is being produced from the balcony of my apartment. For 1 week, I will photograph the life that I can see from up here on the 10th floor. All will be minted in 100 editions at a low price and after the sale period, those that are not sold will be burned.","tags":["varanda","balcony","photography","photo","series","image","2d","life","city","cityscape","building"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmcJ6dU7vqGJNWLoX6gCFAgBSbFxShQGpmybGwewTB92go"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcJ6dU7vqGJNWLoX6gCFAgBSbFxShQGpmybGwewTB92go","display_uri":"ipfs://Qmakq9Y8f5X1oXhLx7eocDWddCp5V3Zq6XiDqfYqwBR4Qx","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

I wrote my first ten books on a manual typewriter of one kind or another\u2026.She [my mother] did day work; she made not very much money\u2026.here she had a daughter begging for a typewriter.\u201d Butler\u2019s blue typewriter dates to the 1970s. It is manual, not electric; fingers must make metal letters leap to leave an inky imprint on paper rolled into the machine by hand.

A very inhospitable and remote planet in the empire. There is no intelligent life this lands, only animal species. He has to control the population of a highly dangerous predatory species, protecting a defenseless species called Doomgers. These small animals produce a substance highly vaulted in the Union for its rarity and utility. Now, Golem lives quietly among the Doomgers, protecting them from his predators, the Yormakz. His life in battle took him through a spiral of violence and degradation, which he decided to put an end to. Even in retirement he continues to do what he does best, protect the weak from the ruthless.\n\nSoundtrack By Gabriel Romero @OpacityLow", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYkx8qDJBAQ7Ayn5CntWJtgG4LZMGmuy8K2rw9wfyX28c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQLdq1kUTNq4iaEWTyXkHLa9PZynnn4Ru66ecQrTHC79y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYkx8qDJBAQ7Ayn5CntWJtgG4LZMGmuy8K2rw9wfyX28c", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bF1c2dZPqtapqP4iCxitkrRfcjZnEiKzw"], "tags": ["lonelyhearts", "future", "space", "collection", "animation", "saga", "love", ""], "extra": {}}

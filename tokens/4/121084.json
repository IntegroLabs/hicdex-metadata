{"name": "Cyclic Cellular Automata - 030", "description": "A cyclic cellular automaton (CCA) is defined as an automaton where each cell takes one of N states 0, 1,\u2026, N-1 and a cell in state i changes to state i+1 mod N at the next time step if it has a neighbor that is in state i+1 mod N, otherwise it remains in state i at the next time step. The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.", "tags": ["generative", "cyclic", "cellula", "automata", "gif"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmX6XAmoU3VM7Z21Y1TmNQib7mYZznXuz8KgN4DYByN99D", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmX6XAmoU3VM7Z21Y1TmNQib7mYZznXuz8KgN4DYByN99D", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1ft8ZPvFdcsMa2LyyA4h53Mm61bRHXBMfc"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX6XAmoU3VM7Z21Y1TmNQib7mYZznXuz8KgN4DYByN99D", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

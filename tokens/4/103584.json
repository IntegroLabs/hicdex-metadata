The artist also trained a SampleRNN model on various environmental sounds. Those AI models generated all music sequences and ambient sounds. The resulting composition reflects the uncertainly of this time and the reminiscence of \"normal\" life. In this work, the artist illustrates that embracing AI's idiosyncratic nature leads to unique outcomes and extends his creativity.

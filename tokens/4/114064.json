We\u2019re glad to have you along for our second mission. My name is Galen, but you know me as the Purple Astrobro. Shall we take a listen to what happened on this mission?  Galens\u2019 Log: We landed on Xentrac Yesterday. The landscape itself was fairly barren. We searched for a while but couldn\u2019t find anything of immense interest. Yet so far, for me it has been the most enjoyable mission. Quinn tripped and fell. It was tough to watch, and I had to turn away. But in retrospect it was quite funny. During the group photo though...I felt something strange, like someone was watching us...but I digress. Our next mission should have a much more lush landscape according to our readings. I am looking forward to it. \u201cEnd Transmission\u201d Sound done by @mrsoyface!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX17wwdT7LQDpgCzrsZmtZksgw3hjhyp9yE5e8h5aUU4k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdX8CCtvk67s7VXpg6xhmq6xCuSKnnNpuENwiCHWKnEdW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1fzLJbhRQSep9NgQZpdPLnCC5AGpWCTpTF"], "tags": ["Scifi", "space", "astronauts", "universe", "galaxy", "planet", "alien", ""], "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmX17wwdT7LQDpgCzrsZmtZksgw3hjhyp9yE5e8h5aUU4k"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmUAztqoaDYUsULFFzz3DbVwaBsEhSSJmRYpyFeAbNQBF6"}, "supply": "10"}

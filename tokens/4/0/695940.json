Have thousand stories but have million mysteries as well.\n\nIn 2012-2013 I became more and more interested in human psychology. I try to capture the depth of story and emotion in human life through the portrait. And then I try to present expressions of happiness, sadness, pain, depression, madness and mystery in the \"Hysteria\" series in 2013. And this work is one that can represent the basic concept behind this series.\n\nThrowback Artwork\n\"Hysterical\"\nBy Fadhlil Abdi\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRLqBhbGVLsg45aDYEyqabeYEoGUZ1YbtN6nPoPwYpt6w", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXTip9QnRuswmvUS93Xwn1eYTiSrpBaqadyKNJxTs2Nky", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRLqBhbGVLsg45aDYEyqabeYEoGUZ1YbtN6nPoPwYpt6w", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz28borFEokESF2JVrEadGAWQA7oG8shrfUJ"], "tags": ["Painting", "realist", "Hyperrealist", ""], "extra": {}}

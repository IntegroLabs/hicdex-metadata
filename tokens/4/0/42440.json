The photo was shot during the great migration which is an annual occurrence of one of Nature's wonders of the world.  All elephants are herd animals with a very definite social structure. It is very uncommon to see one on its own far away from the herd.  This photo was shortlisted in multiple wildlife photography contests.","tags":["AfricanElephant","WildlifePhotography","Nature","Wild","Elephant","NationalGeographic","Safari","MasaiMara","MassaiMara","GreatMigration","SaudiPhotographer","NomadicFrame","Kenya","Africa","Serengeti","GreatMigration","Lonely","Alone","Rare","AnimalSighting","NFT","NFTArt","NFTPhoto","NFTPhotography","Tusks","Ivory","Poachers","WildlifeProtection","WWF","CryptoArt","DigitalArt","ProfessionalPhotography"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmRkMbvWVwqh5Wgu5xVhoMnetajK6pp7wDPSmdEcCyecjB"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRkMbvWVwqh5Wgu5xVhoMnetajK6pp7wDPSmdEcCyecjB","display_uri":"ipfs://QmQHa91xhr8Po18QCZ2xLuNAKPqDuwkkUXRFF6wZcARjPJ","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

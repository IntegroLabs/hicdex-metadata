Please Stand By, The Truth Is Out There. It's official, the X-Files was right, and with the new UFO report released by the US Government claiming they \"could not rule out UFO's as a possibility,\" extraterrestrial life seems as close to a reality as ever. Of the 144 reports catalogued that were reviewed, the government was only able to identify 1 of them. Color palette inspired by the X-Files.

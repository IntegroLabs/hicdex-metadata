We will forever remember the world of now days in two parts: before and after. Terrible events draw their boundaries on the map of time. Our time is becoming a territory in which different opinions, conspiracy theories, propaganda, and the feelings of ordinary people are fighting on different sides. I have always dreamed of stopping time through photography. Now I dream of returning humanity to a territory where there have been no terrible events yet. Beyond the boundaries of time.\n\nFilm photography from personal archive post-war Abkhazia in 2007, boundaries 2022. Original pieces by  Katya Kanke\n\n100% of incoming telos from this piece will be be donated to Ukrainian NGO.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQF2fz2kKrqpixmxEeqnj88ZUqCWyV2WgL2xgrfvdWffr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZZcoB7heXxaiNJ5tbY7NQVtmeucCwjVnjWDQ2cX1WkEm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQF2fz2kKrqpixmxEeqnj88ZUqCWyV2WgL2xgrfvdWffr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L55Xj3jUqXdukotWUmmSDfAMmbvfvwaYQ"], "tags": ["alterhen", "nowar", "bw", "photography"], "extra": {}}

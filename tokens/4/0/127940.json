These are monochrome abstract landscapes influenced by the concept of “mind landscape” which is a cultivated landscape burgeoned in the time of the Yuan dynasty. In this classical Chinese tradition, abstract landscapes are created as a mirror of the artist’s heart and mind; and have no relation to the visible world. The generative landscapes are produced with the same concerns but with modern computational techniques; composed with randomness. The search is for a place where the mind stays away from the chaos of images and associations.","tags":["Generative","Landscape","Chinese","Noise"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmfWxJo8PRYYF3WKqocAzYkDkMfT8yvwPUdrRdB5HtYsG9","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmfWxJo8PRYYF3WKqocAzYkDkMfT8yvwPUdrRdB5HtYsG9","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbAuT29MUxAUb587dQFcm43Z7qg3myfPYoECP1A1NfWtE","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

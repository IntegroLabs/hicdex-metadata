The Xipibo\\Shipibo people are a Panoan-speaking Indian group living in the Amazon.","tags":["Amazon","Shipibo","community","shaman","Icaro","geomtry","sacred","pattern","vision","alteredstate","Psychedelic","realtime","3d","art"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmUpqUhya6dxF3DPTCf7WW7bgcddJ4BnMtom9t4KF3xBCL"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUpqUhya6dxF3DPTCf7WW7bgcddJ4BnMtom9t4KF3xBCL","display_uri":"ipfs://QmPHugDQAcKsnphb8uoEYoWiX48G8D7bdGFFZ1e6hKKEL8","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

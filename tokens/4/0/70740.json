The patterns and songs are called an ICARO. The space and energy around an ICARO becomes elevated, recharged and often renewed. To me they represent the connection and constant cycle of the universe. 100% of sales (and royalties) will be put back into the Shipibo-Conibo community. The Xipibo\\Shipibo people are a Panoan-speaking Indian group living in the Amazon.","tags":["Amazon","Shipibo","community","shaman","Icaro","geomtry","sacred","pattern","vision","alteredstate","Psychedelic","realtime","3d","art"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmUpqUhya6dxF3DPTCf7WW7bgcddJ4BnMtom9t4KF3xBCL"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUpqUhya6dxF3DPTCf7WW7bgcddJ4BnMtom9t4KF3xBCL","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

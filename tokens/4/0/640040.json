I like to see how it looks in different countries and parts of the world. Autumn is a season for leaving the past stuff behind. Let it go. Let it flow. You don\u2019t need that old stuff and that old feelings anymore. Renew yourself. Just keep what you need, what is useful to you. Don\u2019t let that old feelings make you feel bad anymore. Don\u2019t make that old decisions make you feel guilty. La tardor is an opportunity for feeling new, for grow new stuff, for making a new plan for yourself.

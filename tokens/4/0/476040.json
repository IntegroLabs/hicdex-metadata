Built in 1921 by eccentrics Eleanor and George Bridges, the home was a gathering place for influential artists such as Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Earnest Hemingway. When I visited the property with the current owner I was allowed to observe the energy and see if I felt the presence of spirits. The garden feels like there\u2019s always an orchestra, a party that will never ever end. \n\nThis greenhouse has become dilapidated, overgrown with ivy. But it still calls out to visitors, planting seeds of change as the property is soon to be remodeled. You can still feel the presence of someone meticulously watering and transplanting seeds for the secret garden. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYusrwqcUuuq7gH2vxx6V98u8zkbu33SVXZCKHcuD39ZL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmehK7FpYAd7HJ9tJgiQbM8AwT6hnztAijpEfPZdapiPxL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYusrwqcUuuq7gH2vxx6V98u8zkbu33SVXZCKHcuD39ZL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hZ4xUe27QGrigjR7Qk1YYZ2mrWpkaHYDQ"], "tags": ["Ivy", "overgrown", "greenhouse", "pink", "green", "seeds"], "extra": {}}

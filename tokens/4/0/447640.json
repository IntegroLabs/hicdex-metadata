Our infinite potential and present imperfection, like swords to be forged and sharpened throughout Life.\nHe is the rectified Creator Word, who springs straight from the divine heart, who teaches us power and responsibility with our words and actions.\nIt is respect for yourself and others, the limits and healthy permissions for coexistence, internal and external. It is the light of alignment with the Will, which courageously carries out the journey of the inner warrior.\n\nYear: 2020 | Technique: Drawing on 180g black paper.

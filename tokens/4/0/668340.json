There is two types of source: acoustic and electronic stuff. For acoustic stuff, there are sounds from bottle-horn-bowl-sleighbell-clacking, kenthongan, hot water steam, yelling, and many more. For electronic stuff, there are TOA, bad amplifiers, and many more. It is loud and has various types of sounds, yet quite provoking and interesting to hear. For seller and buyer, the sounds become an important sign, because they communicate buyer that the seller is there. Then the trade happens.  \n\nMy aim in this series is to reimagine the sound structure of street food sellers and collect them into an encyclopedia. As I was captivated by the sonic phenomenon, I challenge myself on it to alter the sound, image, and perceptual construction.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQLSE14dAWYRYis9LUiV3BqAJ6co39MVFxVnJoCjequDd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSzcgM3d4pemquzhVToUVo29SK2D546neT84WqKkN62VD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQLSE14dAWYRYis9LUiV3BqAJ6co39MVFxVnJoCjequDd", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg", "compressedAudioUri": "ipfs://QmYq5hyvfFCAchiaoTf5vwncL3P8DYJfY3oBo2Ztq9Tapk", "coverThumbUri": "ipfs://QmTJNqqT52rcthnGadr94p1QYQDjgxTiPsgvrJAFLSaNje"}], "creators": ["tz1V95hDFtaPxUz7yDJM8RrGCWUskukaPJyZ"], "tags": ["experimental", "electroacoustic", "meditative", "soundscape", "healing", "sonicart", "Indonesia", ""], "extra": {}}

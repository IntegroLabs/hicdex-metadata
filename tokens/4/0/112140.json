Still looking for a suitable place to start over. Our train \"The Last Hope\" is holding up well. Today we drove through areas that only smelled of garbage, dirt and death. A big explosion could be seen in the distance, which was stirring up Marilyn, our train pig. I will not give up hope and find a place to create new life that does not want to extinguish itself. My battery is slowly getting weak, so I will put myself in standby mode. Hopefully the next time I wake up I will be in a beautiful and peaceful world. Over and out!","tags":["Cinema4D","Octane","Photoshop","Hope","Train","World","Destruction","Pig","Life",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmYoddVGxNiuPGbVnaS1XducQ9dnnJBKhPNm5RcXLn7971"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYoddVGxNiuPGbVnaS1XducQ9dnnJBKhPNm5RcXLn7971","display_uri":"ipfs://QmcnpunwQz7CzoeQsV6DmRiyfBVm8CUMHXQS6o4AknFNfe","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

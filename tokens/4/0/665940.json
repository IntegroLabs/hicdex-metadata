Then Ravana ordered Hanuman's tail to be burned. Seeing this, Sita prayed that the fire that burned Hanuman's tail would cool down. Because Sita's prayer to Lord Agni was answered, the fire that burned Hanuman's tail became cool. Then he rebelled and released the Brahma Astra that bound him. With his tail blazing like a torch, he set the city of Alengka on fire. The city of Alengka became a sea of fire. After starting a big fire, he threw himself into the sea to extinguish the fire in his tail. The heavenly dwellers praised Hanuman's bravery and said that apart from Sita's residence, the city of Alengka was engulfed in flames.\n\nBringing the good news, Hanoman goes to Rama and tells about Sita's condition. After that, Rama prepared the Vanara troops to attack Alengka", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUr9NyWMYKjwZrwfTrPkFFQxbV5dmfuBTWXqez7wa3jDS", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb5R9zqUUV35PJCpJZKAZZVaSVEw4sPsGWALawhThLwGE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUr9NyWMYKjwZrwfTrPkFFQxbV5dmfuBTWXqez7wa3jDS", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1W6MhBLazYS4ALwQJeJzqvfuJfRLEtoHm8"], "tags": ["god", "HinduDeities", "Hindu", "Hanumon", "Anoman", "Monkey", "Gods", "HinduGod", "nft", "nftart", "nftcommunity", "nftcollector"], "extra": {}}

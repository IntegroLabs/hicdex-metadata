Although, it is important that we step back and look at the bigger picture: the forest that we have journeyed through, the obstacles we have faced and conquered, and how far we've come. And, through the bigger picture, we can often find beauty in how far we've come, and how we're now stronger heading to where we want to go.","tags":["struggle","perseverance","beauty","nature","ai","art","butterfly"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmcznYRvKJQNr78Lg2ykjiaUNRYY6ZJkMg5HzmhiRA277Q","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcznYRvKJQNr78Lg2ykjiaUNRYY6ZJkMg5HzmhiRA277Q","display_uri":"ipfs://QmcznYRvKJQNr78Lg2ykjiaUNRYY6ZJkMg5HzmhiRA277Q","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

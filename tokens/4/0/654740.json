Nature always surprises me most of the time, and when I decide to paint a location, I obsessively look at the frame several times to examine and analyze the different angles of the frame. The colors of each day are different from the paintings of that day. Sometimes the colors are cold and rough and sometimes soft and warm. In my paintings, I try to depict the pristine and untouched nature and remove all the events that human beings have brought to nature today, and instead add beautiful trees and pastures to it. The essence of my Impressive Expression paintings comes from my core soul. I like exploring painting more than anything, and I spend most of my time teaching art and painting and enjoying it", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZjmLtodphVbVLNE6zDb41RqPwdjzWYpQQwqQCrXH84A9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTZvZNVhja26qFHYM3UPnx6GqUCLRnUNKv7r7j1DXNrwF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZjmLtodphVbVLNE6zDb41RqPwdjzWYpQQwqQCrXH84A9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1araUZWTDLmvFb8SuZVmTcbbozk6gsfSRB"], "tags": ["tezos", "nft", "hicetnunc", "cold", "oilpaint", "tree", "nature", ""], "extra": {}}

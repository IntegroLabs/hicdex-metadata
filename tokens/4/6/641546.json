The UV storm was only beginning to further penetrate the space pod, beginning to leave marks on the outside of the space pod. The damage was limited so far, but it was only a matter of time before the inside of the pod began to show the same evidence of damage destroying their vital systems. Most importantly, however, it wasn't long until Abe would be a cooked duck.\n\n\"What should I do\", he told himself as he focused his mind on the task on hand. He wanted to sit down and think for just a minute or two but he knew he wasn't in a position to think about what should be done, he had to execute his previous plans. He had to save his crew and find some type of space mineral to power the generator to cure Abigail. Out of the safety of the space pod and directly into the martian environment he went.\n\n\"It's do or die... for me and my friends...\" he told himself as he stepped foot as the first human being on the planet CR 89. The gravity of the planet was off putting, it was nothing like anything he had ever felt before, in fact he had almost tripped before catching himself mid-fall: \"Gotta be more careful.\", Abe said as he stood up and turned around and went forward. He knew the situation was difficult but deep down he knew he had the skill required to navigate the alien planetoid.\n\n\n\u2014-\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied.

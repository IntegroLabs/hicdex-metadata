The band has a music video for their song titled Coffee & TV, and it was broadcasted on MTV. This song impressed me. The music video was really magical and made me wonder, how they make that kind of thing? The idea was crazy - especially for a music video on that era - for me, who had no clue about how CG works. The awe and the curiosity carried over to me and made me want to make things like that. Then the curiosity has grown into my passion.","tags":["Digital","3DAnimation","Pop"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://Qmdhxm4SMaFpWP4VdqFoz8CWBmHQNrXZWvivzFKw11XbaG"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmdhxm4SMaFpWP4VdqFoz8CWBmHQNrXZWvivzFKw11XbaG","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

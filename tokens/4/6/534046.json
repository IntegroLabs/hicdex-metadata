Each planet has its own unique physical rules.\n\nPlanet #3 is a planet made of gold and other metallic elements. Its gravity is very strong and its rotation is very fast, so all elements near it will rotate at high speed and surround it.\n\nOver time, the lighter metal elements will form a ring around Planet #3.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP88jxfuRTMqkJDD33hZ3Gx3VaVTH7V4LpPpoVZbobzLs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRMyiaGPz646J3JpnpzLg2hK3yoxKXUtv98es5rcUUTvh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP88jxfuRTMqkJDD33hZ3Gx3VaVTH7V4LpPpoVZbobzLs", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1Z3defezrcTcnd1pd6LxWyHQpc5iHZ5syf"], "tags": ["3dart", "abstract", "geometry", "universe", "creativecoding", "lienchengwang", "codeart", "nfts", "space", "generativeart", "algorithm", "p5js", "math", "interactive"], "extra": {}}

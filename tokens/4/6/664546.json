The radio covered the band from 535 to 1605 khz in \"amplitude modulation\" (AM).\nThe two triangles stamped on the chrome dial correspond to the 640 kHz and 1240 kHz frequencies, which were assigned by the U.S. government in the 1950s for special transmissions (activation of an alarm) in case of nuclear war or dangerous radiation in this field. These frequencies could not be used or interfered with by any transmitter (silence zones) and would be used in the event of a nuclear threat in order to inform the population in the event of an atomic threat.\n\nThe song we listen to is \"Quiereme\" interpreted by Carlos Gardel.\n\nNostalgia Objkt #1\n\n@PandaAndrez @MDandrezpanda\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZFLo2JL3yZQRfebYQ8biEbv2GL6yzYFhBC5GKEJnqHhr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcsbCtQdet6MhcaV75mZVdkDXfYxWsnj7HEbCmDhHaDEa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZFLo2JL3yZQRfebYQ8biEbv2GL6yzYFhBC5GKEJnqHhr", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fj8eJC6izBmwX1jjW1SVRNMMd49DW417F"], "tags": ["andrezpanda", "mesadulce", "art", "animation", "digital", "nft", "illustration", "digitalart", "collectible", "", "", "colorful", "trippy", "music", "radio", "nftart", "drawing"], "extra": {}}

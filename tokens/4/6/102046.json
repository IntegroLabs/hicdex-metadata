Addition of colours is based off a selection of colours with random hue, saturation, and brightness values with limitations on the hue. In essence, a predetermined colour scheme was selected by choosing a number of colours and assigning them each a random hue. Every circle graphed thereon has a random hue value from these predetermined hues limited by the number of colours. Saturation and brightness is randomly selected for each circle independently.","tags":["generative","processing","python","circles"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmPKikJeBBjFqz7EXD4eSq1WYwDFiZUf4XvpaAAFUT3G8V"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPKikJeBBjFqz7EXD4eSq1WYwDFiZUf4XvpaAAFUT3G8V","display_uri":"ipfs://QmWSbo6eip8pZqvC1CfAgajc28cuTYxUFPC3as1YanshE8","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

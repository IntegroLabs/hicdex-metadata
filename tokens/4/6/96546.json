Caravaggio’s boy seems soft, innocent and very much naïve. We wanted to  show an extreme view of how times are different now, kids are no longer  naïve and that sense of innocence is lost. This piece of art was kindly donated by YAKKA Collective for the #objkts4palestine initiative.  All proceeds go directly to The Palestine Children's Relief Fund (https://www.pcrf.net/).

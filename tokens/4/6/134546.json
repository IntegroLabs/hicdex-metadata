{"__version": 1, "token_id": 134546, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LOVE after Dan and Swampy - 1", "description": "\"LOVE after Dan and Swampy\" is part of a larger series of animated works involving redraws of screenshots depicting Dr. Zone. The subject matter is a character from \"Milo Murphy's Law\", a show created by Dan Povenmire and Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh, the duo behind \"Phineas and Ferb\". In \"Milo Murphy's Law\", the show Dr. Zone is from, he is often on the margins of the plot, not doing much for the show. You can argue that he's just a cog in someone else's wheel.   I present four pieces in one video. Each of them spell out the word \"LOVE\" in International Morse Code. There are two types of frames: one is a more literal redraw of a screenshot that adjusts Dr. Zone's face to look less Euro-centric and more like Jemaine Clement, a Maori. The second type is a loose interpretation of Dr. Zone as a theatrical shadow character that borrows aesthetics from Javanese/Sundanese art and Maori art, as they share similar characteristics.  As I make these artworks, Dr. Zone is remade from a side character into the main protagonist of my series of works. He is reborn with a new aesthetic, one that is similar to my culture and his voice actor and design inspiration Jemaine Clement's. Not only that, his personality and story is reinvented. It is one full of love and passion to take the narrative. | ig: nurlakarya", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYy7fRRYYaDj5bQN99EegmULmPtG1JxUcB5hmebAfTxe7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeQhczJhe5LhVeDPakLD1TYh1xyTEjXH6Usi8TAbgYUW2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYy7fRRYYaDj5bQN99EegmULmPtG1JxUcB5hmebAfTxe7", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RDCc48hPeYxYUfYknbee78ffAXKF8fsF6"], "tags": ["cartoon", "disney", "drzone", "animation", "illustration", "drawing", "postcolonialism", "appropriation", "love"], "extra": {}}

Originally it had four insect-like  legs, and no skull or faces. Later I sat and doodled while in a teams meeting, and found an odd looking head. Took it into Procreate and started playing with it. Hm, I thought to myself, might I combine this with that old 3d sculpt? So I mirrored it, moved it around, sketched, and boom! Janus was born.\nThis is a very different take on Janus, the Greek God of portals, history, gateways.... He is usually pictured with two faces facing in opposite directions. One looking into the future, and the other looking to the past. Mine is faced towards each other, looking at it self. Do we humans really learn from our history, and use this knowledge to look forward into the future?\nMade in Procreate on iPad 12.9 with apple pencil and my own pencil brushes.\n\nJanus \nthe divine keeper of the past and future\nThe watcher of portals\nreminding his subjects to look into the future\nwith the knowledge of the past\nHumankind\nthe self obsessed\nthe short sighted\ndenied their God his rights\nto look beyond himself", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZQRmKK5d19ht5rCZNexCSGxRcuRnPWEJF7idAV5EWP1q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP1DRyBwqiUgPQ3aygKhUhahrfvHAKgNGdb5VpYVQd2YX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZQRmKK5d19ht5rCZNexCSGxRcuRnPWEJF7idAV5EWP1q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TW3YfKY44cS1uKEEfsnyuNFbkzydeayq9"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "ipad", "darkart", "painting", "drawing", "classic", "scifi", "fantasy", ""], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 667746, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SHADOW", "description": "Irony; it abounds all around. A marriage counselor files for divorce. A fire station burns down. A police station gets robbed. A cobbler's child has no shoes. And the list goes on and on. In SHADOW, the irony here is that there are no actual shadows for the word SHADOW. None of these words have any shadows when they clearly should because of the perspective or vantage point we're given. The light source is coming from the right. The shadows off of the words of SHADOW should have shadows coming towards the left and slightly down. I originally made the image with the shadows, but actually preferred it without actual shadows for SHADOWs. The allure of mystery and the desire of near stark minimalism drives me to keep things as simple as possible for the most part. Less is more than more is more.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV9nigAmrCqzjcJH4rziUrjzfrVzZTq6s6V3pz3pMWeE6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV2ncJQmPu6V2uWgaRXZAgDnqbScjofxHWPNH2dhdMo13", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV9nigAmrCqzjcJH4rziUrjzfrVzZTq6s6V3pz3pMWeE6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

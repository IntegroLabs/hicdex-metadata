It wasn\u2019t her appearance, it wasn\u2019t how she acted; there was just something \u201cother\u201d about her, an aura (if you believe in that sort of thing). Drinks were on the house for what she\u2019d done for the people around here, but she always insisted on paying. Before she was the captain of the \u201cK\u201d, she had stood at the helm of the \u201cRagnarok\u201d. If you\u2019re from these parts, that\u2019s all that needs to be said. If you\u2019re not, all you need to know is that Kasper and her crew died protecting this place after being ambushed by three rogue ships. Data from the auto-doc showed that she was dead for a full 6 minutes before being resuscitated. The rest of the \u201cRagnarok\u201d weren\u2019t as lucky. She was different after. Some say it was PTSD, but if you ask me... I don't know where she went for those 6 minutes, but something came back with her\u2026\n\nThis piece was created as a prize for a fan fiction entry by @lokisnfts who wrote the character description which I used to create the art.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ4HbqsFzg1W6G14otDHf4MHu1DFwBdhNWf3VeNFpvuzE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPMScptuk7M6CFE4Y987EFVXCXj35JkBvgarvkkpKbkqM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ4HbqsFzg1W6G14otDHf4MHu1DFwBdhNWf3VeNFpvuzE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MY1BKQd2QFDDsjCpkKi6vVDxPKycGiJA3"], "tags": ["vessesl", "fanfiction"], "extra": {}}

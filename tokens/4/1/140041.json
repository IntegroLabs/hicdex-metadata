He told me he had stolen and hidden my marijuana bag, the fabric of which had been made from Mondrian's soul. And on top of that, he said he wouldn't even give me a drag on that cigarette.

I'll tell you later.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdc9r9M7h5HKVmBfxweUFgo1kkcjKXsT2momjZPLoCaNs", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdc9r9M7h5HKVmBfxweUFgo1kkcjKXsT2momjZPLoCaNs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdc9r9M7h5HKVmBfxweUFgo1kkcjKXsT2momjZPLoCaNs", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZhZnNDbg5XyurR2rPB7eNwZuAf4Jow6XJ"], "tags": ["CryptoDealer", "Weed", "PixelArt", "DigitalArt"], "extra": {}}

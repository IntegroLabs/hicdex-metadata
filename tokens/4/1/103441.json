Each of these worlds is created by \"hand\" and titled with respect to a randomly generated mixture of the attributes that describe the drivers of the four future archetypes. The total possible permutations of future worlds according to this mashup method is 16000+. Squared #2 is the second set of 16. The individual pieces are available exclusively on H=N, and are rendered at 2000x2000.","tags":["animation","manyworlds","permutations","possibilities","squaredseries"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmVrnwHG8nZTSsc1QmSTVogdsVrLrQ3EQ92ZFRp7ZH5Zxs"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVrnwHG8nZTSsc1QmSTVogdsVrLrQ3EQ92ZFRp7ZH5Zxs","display_uri":"ipfs://QmQ1YLC5vvafrY7KxWqH2Xnoxc2B2e78fHR7qyhLu47oRw","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

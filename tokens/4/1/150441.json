{"__version": 1, "token_id": 150441, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Liquid Reflections #1", "description": "Liquid Reflections Series examines the possibilities of using liquid forms and symmetry to create abstract images. Each image is a fight between order and chaos, where order imposed by the symmetry clashes with the fluidity of colours that cannot be contained in their boundaries. It is a fight of contradicting forces that govern our lives. Series consists of 8 artworks, each work is 4000x4000 pixels. This is the multi-edition-low-cost OBJKT of the series where others are 2/2 OBJKTs.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma5xtoanyo1Nrac1yS78JSgevcsRJHwEveUwdBgpPcBsa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNVNb8q5srTCA2WdN8HRSuCWXrTC2KS82xQmGZfJkKkhh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma5xtoanyo1Nrac1yS78JSgevcsRJHwEveUwdBgpPcBsa", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1dFVePa546aLxLEKWmW2Xf9UKwYcJnTn5J"], "tags": ["Abstract", "abstractart", "modernart", "single", "abstractComposition", "liquidreflections", "papermarbling"], "extra": {}}

The images from this series reflect this quality. They are details of buildings of different architectural styles/ages, all reminiscing geometric abstractions by Piet Mondrian, Josef Albers, El Lissitzky and the like. I captured these images this year in Berlin.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSwMJe9gDVxf6xQ52UVWsMHzWWP1yz7GEhYVhVfM8Wafe", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmar42kpqPHoNLq1gRrx69tpmEDgvSzGoEy8bQvU3cX8Vm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSwMJe9gDVxf6xQ52UVWsMHzWWP1yz7GEhYVhVfM8Wafe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cEcJqrV5PtGQ1MFvmQsXg2X1wx62eSGv4"], "tags": ["photography", "minimalism", "architecturephotography", "geometricart", ""], "extra": {}}

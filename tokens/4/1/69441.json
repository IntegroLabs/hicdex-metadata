They have the ability to become invisible to humans and can use their long, flexible tails as a whip. Sigbin are said to come out of their lairs during Holy Week. During this time, they attack unsuspecting children and tear out their hearts so they can fashion them into amulets.","tags":["Sigbin","aswang","cryptid","monster","creature","mythology","myth","Philippines","Filipino","Pilipino","Pinoy","black","dark","illustration","digital"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmPC91hK2c7H1HfRs9PAYfLSb1yms9GAMq12UbjpnV9zHq"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPC91hK2c7H1HfRs9PAYfLSb1yms9GAMq12UbjpnV9zHq","display_uri":"ipfs://QmUnzY2oK5kn18ffTdSQT35nLeeiEPop5GBcLyUAW2cW9W","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

He loves all things tech and is an avid roblox fanatic! When he was 2 I used to give him my phone and he would create these awesome digital paintings that my wife and I loved so I would save them because I thought they would make really dope T shirts. Fast forward a few years and the NFT space emerged and I thought how dope this would be to create NFTs of his work. Here it is, the first in the series. Notice his color choices and placement! Pretty dope! I added some animation to it as well.","tags":["G3/G4","djbooman","boomannft","grantasticgamer","nftart","baltimore"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmX6ZQiWLmA2TAouduHNgGoafpn2WR9tyeF1Yu9JwUsb4w"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmX6ZQiWLmA2TAouduHNgGoafpn2WR9tyeF1Yu9JwUsb4w","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

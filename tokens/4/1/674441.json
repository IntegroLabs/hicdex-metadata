A route without a point of arrival. I was raring to go even when I think of walking along that route again and again. Nothing special about it and the scenery was almost a clich\u00e9. I usually made the walks during the times of turmoil in my mind; trying to get a clear view. Funnily enough, I\u2019ve never had a clear idea why I was walking this route consistently.\n\nOne day, I decided to find an answer. \n\nAnd this is that day.\n\nThe route here, starts from my then-home on Argyle Road and follows south to the beach over London Road, and sometimes over Lewes Road. Then, after the Palace Pier, it takes a right to the west end of the city and ends by the Hove Lagoon. I have never used the same route for the return and have always improvised it by going through the city. \n\nThere is no there in terms of a destination here as I said; since this route, this little voyage, is in fact a range.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeA3sxt8cwuBHJCNBG4hX2yVvFo5ECRDxwgwCQf9L5mKG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXBCJQ7oJwTD8qWKmNndrzYPjpSofNzCooiZjg7rE4Dss", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeA3sxt8cwuBHJCNBG4hX2yVvFo5ECRDxwgwCQf9L5mKG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bcVzBoYRLiUV3VyUM98CndLoHD7HFZZUV"], "tags": ["photography", "brighton", "england", "uk", "street"], "extra": {}}

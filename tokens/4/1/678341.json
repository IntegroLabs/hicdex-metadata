{"__version": 1, "token_id": 678341, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Tahakopa Rock", "description": "Tahakopa Beach lies in the Catlins area in the deep south of Aotearoa New Zealand's Te Waipounamu South Island \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff It's a bit off the beaten track but is worth the drive along some narrow farm roads and a wander down a path to beach with tall cliffs at the north end. \n\nIt was at the base of the looming cliffs I took a series of photos of some interesting weathered boulders. Their relatively soft sandstone had been sculpted by erosion into fantastic textures which I knew I wanted to explore with this computational drawing technique.\n\nThis drawing was created by heavily editing the original photograph to enhance specific features, then exploring a range of random seed values with a creative coding tool (vpype flow-imager) and manually tweaking parameters on a few favourite results until the final version presented itself. \n\nIt was drawn by an AxiDraw SE/A3 plotter using Uniball Signo pens on Art Spectrum Colourfix 300gsm fine art paper. The dark green colour primer on this stock reflects the colours of the coastal forest in this area.\n\n4000x5500px JPG\n\nPhotographed Feb 6 2022 \nProcessed + plotted Feb 18/19 2022\n\njimmykl.tez\nhttps://jimmy.is", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSRYwSANya57fVR6gYnWc3e2xWgoJe3Xr3HPx2ePdN3HA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTaVjyUCAynbq98zCArZfxwDJ9ubttyUMUJgckh1TuFwt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmPFBWUtJbw7fwBcrtE6FNHWnMAAoEuLYKgb55VRCiw3dy", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSRYwSANya57fVR6gYnWc3e2xWgoJe3Xr3HPx2ePdN3HA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hZ7Q55pbwK26Se2U32iLk57LH4pxGN6VE"], "tags": ["plotter", "drawing", "physical", "physicaldrawing", "computationaldrawing", "lineart", "flowfield", "python", "plotterart"], "extra": {}}

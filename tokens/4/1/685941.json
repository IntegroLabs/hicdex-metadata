Maybe some of them don't know Indonesia, but get to know Bali. However, now Bali has changed a lot of culture, nature, and the habit of continuing to change and shift as many people come there.\n\nIn this artwork I want to describe the condition (in 2011) when I visited there. Hopefully Bali remains good even though it is attacked by modern and can survive and beautiful until anytime.\n\nThrowback Artwork\nBy Fadhlilabdi\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQzJPYqzwrY2stmicHifMpMnRP1E5a11QjeAesDA9w8x9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUrqp2LziRHph1kqB7xzuAp4jmxKcdKemrGDrCpYC38dz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQzJPYqzwrY2stmicHifMpMnRP1E5a11QjeAesDA9w8x9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz28borFEokESF2JVrEadGAWQA7oG8shrfUJ"], "tags": ["realist", "bali", "hyperrealist", "pointilis"], "extra": {}}

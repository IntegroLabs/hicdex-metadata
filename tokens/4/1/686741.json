{"__version": 1, "token_id": 686741, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Umbrella", "description": "\"Umbrella\" is the result of my observation of the psychological side of the people affected by this war. Many who do not know but become victims, a lot of tears and blood, people who lost hope. This is really very sad, sacrificing many things just for the benefit of which may only be enjoyed by a few people or groups. \n\nAs an artist, I can't do much. I only able to pray and return to the studio to make art. artwork that encapsulates and represents the feelings and emotions of many people, a work that has hope, and may it bring peace.\n\nUmbrella is a artwork with hope that the war will end, conflict can be quelled and no one will be a victim. rain must over and live surrounded by lots of love.\n\n\"Why should there be war, if problems can be solved by communication like a friendship\"\nwar must end and live in peace full of love.\n\nRegards,\n\nMontha", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW9ExWsCCs5NGREXj4KmqKCFBNMvGTjcmcBvqiWBZxTtz", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcb3V9yJTe7R3bUjYeNkzwsvCDCzNePz5TUMbFowRe3JZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW9ExWsCCs5NGREXj4KmqKCFBNMvGTjcmcBvqiWBZxTtz", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz29vLDxXiXkU5SY75ebaCmkJRSUuMRrBUf2"], "tags": ["Montha", "PopSurealism", "lowbro", ""], "extra": {}}

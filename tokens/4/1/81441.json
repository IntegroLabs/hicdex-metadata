I did not draw since I was a child. Today I was talking to my sister @luanamallorquin what we could eat tonight and we did not agree in anything haha. I have been in love with pixel art since we started minting 2 months ago and since then I have been postponing it. Today I gave it a try. It was really fun. It took some hours and I reaaally enjoyd doing this after 15+ years. If this sells we are eating sushi with our grandparents xD","tags":["first","pixelart","drawing","after","yeaaars","loveit","sushi","gif"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmURNYxGhmciNjx6A3ezmnKcdNWh3gkdij6tba7ZdoLdws"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmURNYxGhmciNjx6A3ezmnKcdNWh3gkdij6tba7ZdoLdws","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

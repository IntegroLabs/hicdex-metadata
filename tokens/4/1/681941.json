Of a sudden I hear none, all the stars shined none.\nIt was the sweetest odd I met, I was too to it. Of a sudden we, the odd, feel and fill. \nUntil no odd no more, only us, more and more. Though the feelings shoot me out to the infinity, it feeds me the uncertainty.\nTo whom the hands I hold, you have my hands too.

To understand how this attack works, imagine, by way of example, a user who connects to the network and asks, in turn, to be connected to the IP address of a particular website. Unbeknownst to them, a third interlocutor, the so-called man in the middle. The first thing a hacker does in this attack is to intercept Internet traffic before it reaches its destination. One of the most popular methods is the \"spoofing\" of IP addresses. Through spoofing, hackers falsify the true source of the data they send to the computer, giving it a legitimate and original appearance. The data is transmitted online in small packets, each with a tag that identifies it. Hackers who use this technique replace the tag with one recognized by the target user's computer (the same attack can, however, be launched against a smartphone or other similar device), resulting in the device ending up communicating with an imposter. which, however, has the same appearance as the original source of the data.","tags":["#cryptoart#hacker#attak#DIGITALart"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmQW8h3xefrJigbPcxzbatvv1H98YeYXRqQcU8HZp9apos"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQW8h3xefrJigbPcxzbatvv1H98YeYXRqQcU8HZp9apos","display_uri":"ipfs://QmPnxGLS3CPSxctbW7y8eEfeuQ3dwzp9UKQKExuh4vw3RS","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

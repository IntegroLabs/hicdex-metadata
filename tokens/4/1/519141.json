The next one I make will cost 5 tez. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWxjtYJbEXM8gSQX3tubYJi3iBLnNw36gqk8SgHmasqyv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbW8o87gUJo9UcnhEy9RKyp2JNtkSSxeJDcLeMrzuS1Ve", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWxjtYJbEXM8gSQX3tubYJi3iBLnNw36gqk8SgHmasqyv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NHP2mmBNbagWLLnaKM3C1QCtmuk2Qjg26"], "tags": ["portrait", "pfp", "1/1", "unique", "art", "fineart", "abstract", "abstrktobjkt", "digital", "nongenerative", ""], "extra": {}}

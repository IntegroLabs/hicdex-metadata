I composed this piece in 2019 while flying to South Africa after a visit to Zimbabwe. There is an underlying deep sadness in this country which escaped colonialism only to be slow,y starved by kleptocracy. This song was completely composed on my iPad and shows the expressive range of MIDI instruments when using aftertouch. https://youtu.be/IW76QV9SkEs ","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYTedwvsxc6JqCMRFMwwANHdn3DiKyJNCLMx6ddkuELTL","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmYTedwvsxc6JqCMRFMwwANHdn3DiKyJNCLMx6ddkuELTL"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmRyduEZkTFPhuJVqknkBwDWSmup5WehkGVdDh4zsmuEiS"},"supply":"10","transfered":19}

The color gradients represent the passage between different emotions, the different applied materials constitute the complex identity of the human being and the lighting presents the object as something desirable.   It is your outer face, the one that is presentable to others and the one that receives approval while hiding the truth. 2160Ã—2700 pixels / 96x76 cms.

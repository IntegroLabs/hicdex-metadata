Seafarers, adventurers, sailors. Helpless, lost, in this abyss of my own.  Show me the light, in this void of my own. Terror, horror, fright. Bring me home, take me from this void of my own.   Inside of me, used to be a whole world. Pushed aside, let me go. Save me from you, who used to be my whole world.","tags":["art","artwork","darkart","illustration","3dart","blender"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmZAnSVE3nmSVQRvviJqwJpGRCyapXe4HNCwNxCM5uPDHb"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZAnSVE3nmSVQRvviJqwJpGRCyapXe4HNCwNxCM5uPDHb","display_uri":"ipfs://Qmau91YvfiS4i2rjeGPkeiHfdgKc13wPaovzvDfJFKjaXT","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

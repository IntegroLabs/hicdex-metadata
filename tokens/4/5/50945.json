He has not yet experienced the ups and downs of life, leaving him unaware of the magnitude of life's challenges, and the strength and potential he holds. When The Fool comes up in a Tarot reading, you are encouraged to take on his open, willing energy and embrace all that lies ahead of you without worry.","tags":["tarot","card","thefool","major","arcana","illustration","nft"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmVS2hHknctFNhpatFyPgVppFSWWHB8rHqYnHH8sXFeU5v"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVS2hHknctFNhpatFyPgVppFSWWHB8rHqYnHH8sXFeU5v","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVb3t4VH7hGWRBHgf5DFJeoXE8ahKj52btkaavmNfP7D8","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

I am trying to find interesting patterns among the chaos. The initial conditions are randomized and not stored, so each OBJKT represents a unique instance of the simulation, now gone forever. Find the source code here https://github.com/atomoton/threebodyproblem/blob/master/WIP/chaos_theory.p8 to see any changes to the simulation or visualization code.","tags":["pico8","simulation","physics","chaos","animated","series","experimental","opensource","collectable","collectible","generative"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmZ6QchDE563668uvzPHrpZFR1hcMDDU3juwUL2uH6PCj8"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZ6QchDE563668uvzPHrpZFR1hcMDDU3juwUL2uH6PCj8","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

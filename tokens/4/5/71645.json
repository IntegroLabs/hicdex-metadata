This collaboration was dedicated to the richest NFT artist of our time, well known as Beepl. This man worked like a bee during 5000 or more days. Inspired by his incredible success many people start to create NFT from your own art works. He brought us together, and we assembled him through our 256 pictures piece by piece in return.

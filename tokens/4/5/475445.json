The gate is always residing in the heart, welcoming every living and dead to look around. Cold but able to burn, fetid but revealing memories, and narrow but could open up the cuts that have been scratched.  This trip will end, the question is when and how it happened and what will happen afterwards.\n\n2019\nArtwork: Vidi Nurhadi Ranadipura\nPhotographer: Burhan Amaludin\n\nJPEG\n2707 x 4053 pixel", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb3e4i1LnEa86L12HgLmWC23WHpFHL1Au7N165ghHZXBD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUR4mSXdo6NSv1oK6s7icHk5CvgSgDvLRm8UdjdHsdRBB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb3e4i1LnEa86L12HgLmWC23WHpFHL1Au7N165ghHZXBD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XEXE3YqNBYfWVentyoWhNA1FGcHpV64DC"], "tags": ["maternaldisaster", "maternaldisaster", "photography", "gravengates", "artinstallation", "nftphotography", "forever16", ""], "extra": {}}

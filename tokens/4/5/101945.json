Geometric shapes and jagged lines fill the remaining space, arcs curl out of the center light.   Each shape and crooked line having its own indecisive color.    As you step in it feels as tho you are falling forward.  falling towards the light in the precipice, prismatic feeling waves of light dance across you.  Made with jwildfire and adobe after effects.

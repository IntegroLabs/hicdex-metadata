I don\u2019t know why but there\u2019s a sense of nostalgia associated with it. What could be more nostalgic than watching a lighthouse as the time passes over it. I tried to communicate that feeling by digitally recording a time-lapse (sequence of still images) and color graded the video to simulate the 16 mm film negative.  Now, what could be more nostalgic than watching a lighthouse shot on 16 mm film?  Here are the Specs. What: Video / Format: MP4 / Duration: 11 Seconds / Resolution: 1920 x 1080 / Aspect Ratio: Academy Ratio 1.37:1 (letterbox) / Compilation of a sequence of 213 still images playing at 24 images per second to give an illusion of the passage of time. Digitally produced and color graded to simulate 16 mm film.\u2028", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdpNu6grvzTB2YYkxMMfEoScRpmAUzU2Cq7LBzJRf1XJj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfDzSbSShAZnJ6fMHDWPqaffVRC2WA34CbXUT1uxkn1NG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdpNu6grvzTB2YYkxMMfEoScRpmAUzU2Cq7LBzJRf1XJj", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hwbi5hkzKXAA6P5DtXrHBb3RhsKSc4Z8Y"], "tags": ["film", "video", "timelapse", "lighthouse", "grain", "16mm", "35mm", "turkey", "nostalgia", "solitude", "beach", "sea", "ocean", "nature", "lo-fi"], "extra": {}}

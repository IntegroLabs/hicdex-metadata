Please Stand By, Back To The USSR. With Russia seemingly invading the Ukraine, and Putins recent excursions into Kazakhstan and Belarus it seems as if he is intent on attempting to recreate that which has been lost, the Soviet Union. Unable to let go of what once was, Putin will seemingly stop at nothing to bring back a united Soviet Block. Colors inspired by both the Ukrainian and  Soviet flags.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWnucM9TNBRfbx2tRmL59Psw5LjDKmV5nEayvRWdB37kU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaYnLa8mPCCFy59RWDpv7ZDBWbbVuCHvxZMNVfogaYsxV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWnucM9TNBRfbx2tRmL59Psw5LjDKmV5nEayvRWdB37kU", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}

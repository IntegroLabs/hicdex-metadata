{"__version": 1, "token_id": 663645, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SEMAR", "description": "Semar has a very unique physical form, as if he is a symbol of the depiction of the universe. Its round body is a symbol of the earth, where humans and other creatures live. Semar is always smiling, but with puffy eyes. This depiction as a symbol of joy and sorrow. His face is old but his hair is cut in a bun like a child, as a symbol of old and young. He is male, but has breasts like a girl, as a symbol of man and woman. He was the incarnation of a god but lived as a commoner, as a symbol of superiors and subordinates.\n\n\ndimensions\t:2500 x 2500 pixel\nresolution\t:300 dpi\ncreator\t\t:vincen riyan\ntwitter\t\t:https://twitter.com/vincen_riyan", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmegdASwPhRkd5ypw45UBG7prmT4rxRX1EjJdSYx43hQnQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfBJdsNtp5nkHsMpkBpUjUKRoBDcdThjnnwLmvqeW3Hsm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmegdASwPhRkd5ypw45UBG7prmT4rxRX1EjJdSYx43hQnQ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1KuvUfCic6oeHXRT5zY12Az7vf3fPLh9Q4"], "tags": ["semar", "caricature", "indonesian", "java", "figure", "illustration", "art"], "extra": {}}

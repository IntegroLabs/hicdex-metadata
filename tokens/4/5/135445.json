It occurred in a moment of solitude at the beginnings and ends of pivotal changes in my life. I have kept this picture for years as a reminder of how life can change and grow, though the process itself is not always pleasant. Few things worthwhile in life are painless though. I offer this series as a 1-100 mint for my inaugural debut for my works on Hic and appreciate your patronage. I will reveal my identity in due time.","tags":["beach","photography","first","mint","timeless"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmdZJAbPEqyVLb6KKdJQsU8o4gw8RzL6uUUhHCipQRy9f2","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdZJAbPEqyVLb6KKdJQsU8o4gw8RzL6uUUhHCipQRy9f2","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXir1SeW6BMp1KEwJfGhvZJQvAm5Dy9t1LtFC7ahyvsMw","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

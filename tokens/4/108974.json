I've Been Bought Out By Disney. With  Amazon's purchase of MGM studios  all video media has been consolidated into 7 companies, Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney, AT&T Warner Media, NBC Universal and Viacom CBS, with Disney owning many of the major brands / franchises including Lucasfilm, Marvel, Pixar, ESPN, National Geographic, and Hulu. This type of consolidation is dangerous and will continue to homogenize everything.

This portrait is from Wendy Song, an actress. She sat for my robots in Hong-Kong during the Human Study #1/ArtUnchained solo show at Artistree last November. This portrait is produced with a mixture of processes: neural net based image transform using a model train with masked sitters who sat for my robots in Dubai and Hong Kong and a generative system similar to the one controlling my robots' behaviours. @patricktresset","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbbZUwscCPw1pAZq5rnDcw1gNUHEVBcSKzeJYCsGzy5N2","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmbbZUwscCPw1pAZq5rnDcw1gNUHEVBcSKzeJYCsGzy5N2"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmfN6fbLWAeXzRQsFrDqxKZbwBotV9qRghtpEfwVR2hp5q"},"supply":"5","transfered":5}

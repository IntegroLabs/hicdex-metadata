It is based on the idea that our physical bodies or what we call matter are essentially created from key elements that make up the universe, and that somehow, these elements are in motion because of positive or negatives energies that repel or attract one another. I believe modulation, frequency and time are essential to the makeup of the universe, besides the elements themselves.

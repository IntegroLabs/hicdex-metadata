The same value as in 2007 right before the crash. We are up and running at 568.000.000 shares and $639.000.000.000.000 in assets. Obviously riding on two horses, drunk and rich or/and sober and rich. REDRUM is all failures in one move. A drink to get drunk and poor which is rich \u2013 and or both nor neither \u2013 All at the same time always never again. Lehman Brothers are infiltrating failure with failure, ending the apocalypse, drunk driving mad maxing - the fiasco in more than full speed. Drawing on the link between liquor and celebration of value \u2013 even as celebration of literature and as a great drink \u2013 ecstacy and euphoria \u2013 defines our highest value of western society.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYZUEppKr9DMPqQ2w4uQPk1ZMTjKx1v6gdQ3vyDdt2jyi", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd72thyDgDE3pWur7NNkfyzPXpdrzrDLwxxxbw7Jx2PUc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1frB7XBFpjverysEc4TCB7eXJncndWDUrq"], "tags": ["whitepaper", "lehmanbrothers", "redrom"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "application/pdf", "uri": "ipfs://QmYZUEppKr9DMPqQ2w4uQPk1ZMTjKx1v6gdQ3vyDdt2jyi"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://Qmb6BCngJShKFuZjnt8jV3dQPJ77tdRNHR1926RXpLdFFT"}, "supply": "1", "transfered": 0}

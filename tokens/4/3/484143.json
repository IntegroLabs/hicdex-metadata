That is the soul standing upon the crossroad of vacillation. You search for wisdom, but achieve only a stasis of will.\"\n\nStasis: It's dedicated to that moment where being in stasis causes disruption. The moment where one chooses to be different and sets inward a particular motion. In that waking moment, you decide your destiny.\n--\n\"BINARY EMOTIONS\" is a series based on 12 Single Edition Fragments in which the artist aims to translate his inner nuances within a specific moment into visuals that evoke certain emotions. An emotional journey digitized into a binary piece cataloged onto the blockchain.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeECunqix2Ykm8A5u8XwuQPG6BJNB3tzqtLTURZEq4DYe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcXPQhov3xMYm3w2Fonf4LkNxGLwEMtUihebVFDXz1JXP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeECunqix2Ykm8A5u8XwuQPG6BJNB3tzqtLTURZEq4DYe", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bjGdjBLbwdr8ptGcjakKAeM6TLU6UzLgP"], "tags": ["stasis", "decision", "belief", "destiny", "liquid", "black", "goo", "vessel", "rare", "fragment", "six", "maze", "stuck", "travel", "choose", "binary", "emotion", "nuance", "light", "firstlight", "fragment", "series", "scifi", "animation", "glitch", "colors", "tech", "cyberpunk", "dark", "music", "sound"], "extra": {}}

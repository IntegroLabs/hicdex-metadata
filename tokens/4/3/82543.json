Ben is a young architect who suddenly appears in a dangerous, apocalyptic world. He knows what he's doing there - He's on a mission to investigate the city. The only person he gravitates towards and communicates with is a violent, rebellious anarchist. It soon becomes apparent that they both share knowledge about the city: They both know that it changes. The city's plan, its buildings, roads, streets - everything changes, disappears and reappears elsewhere - suddenly and without warning. Surprisingly, no other person is aware of the changes to the city but the two of them. Together they embark on a journey in which a new, futuristic world unfolds before them, while attempting to learn the reason behind the city's transformations. Their journey will change the way they view the world. Outskirts of Vision is a graphic novel about cities - What constitutes a \"good\" city? Do city planners really have control over the success of the cities they design? Is there a way to visit a city before it has been built? To know how it will develop beforehand?","tags":["comics","art","comicbooks","comic","drawing","illustration","comicart","comicbook","artist","sketch","igcomicfamily","anime","cartoon","digitalart","cosplay","artwork","draw","comiccollector","comicstrip","architecture","cyberpunk","punk","design","graphicnovel","graphicnovels"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmRpJ9zhGp4Vi1TE2qb8znUXxoGXGyHe9t9pSnCwqJc3Xe"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRpJ9zhGp4Vi1TE2qb8znUXxoGXGyHe9t9pSnCwqJc3Xe","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTY22LTcbMNLqTnspNK3WHvGcvZsmQbGvxwa8R1UNDwoN","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

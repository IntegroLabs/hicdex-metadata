It's a humble reminder to keep myself grounded no matter what the circumstances are around me and not to fall victim (again) to the consumerism culture that can warp your sense of reality. For me, it is like a great First Nations stone inukshuk; a stone guide-like structure that uses it's arms to help lost travelers find their way, locate food, find shelter. Inukshuks, Teddy, and his people have such amazing wisdom. I try to learn from their knowledge, wisdom, and compassion as lessons to improve my life. I have only the utmost respect for First Nations culture, language, art, etc. I explicitly will only show my appreciation and never appropriation of their culture.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbam3pGn1ZYzU14xRx4T7o4NTQDSJ3EbHBAjjULsoo2yp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRAhHr5FygKrB8xAMXjfZPfTonvvYJnaprz9kLyGw5KiX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbam3pGn1ZYzU14xRx4T7o4NTQDSJ3EbHBAjjULsoo2yp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

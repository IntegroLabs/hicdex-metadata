My work flow has been varying too much as time goes by, but my experience has not stopped increasing, I am a faithful believer that you can never be worse than the day before, every day is an improvement, a learning or an experience.  But what is of being if you don't have a critical thinking? you always need to see everything from better angles, without prejudices or weird things, only reason speaks, and that's why I decided to create this, a ball corrupted by itself, the reflection is altered, life is clouded and the ball is broken.","tags":["0xLxxl","Absurdism","Thoughts"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmeSTWNxwF15oGn9o3nK7ggPAHMF27NNgbUj8Gvnjk2dE1","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmeSTWNxwF15oGn9o3nK7ggPAHMF27NNgbUj8Gvnjk2dE1","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTqGAU9qFgPxg7kvvtKSwm8tdyBwcDE89VavjaQVQC3qe","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

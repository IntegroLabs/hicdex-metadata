My work flow has been varying too much as time goes by, but my experience has not stopped increasing, I am a faithful believer that you can never be worse than the day before, every day is an improvement, a learning or an experience.  But what is of being if you don't have a critical thinking? you always need to see everything from better angles, without prejudices or weird things, only reason speaks, and that's why I decided to create this, a ball corrupted by itself, the reflection is altered, life is clouded and the ball is broken.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeSTWNxwF15oGn9o3nK7ggPAHMF27NNgbUj8Gvnjk2dE1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTqGAU9qFgPxg7kvvtKSwm8tdyBwcDE89VavjaQVQC3qe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeSTWNxwF15oGn9o3nK7ggPAHMF27NNgbUj8Gvnjk2dE1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SGoKJAdNunz1pBZe1a1Et8icfHjXoSa9j"], "tags": ["0xLxxl", "Absurdism", "Thoughts"], "extra": {}}

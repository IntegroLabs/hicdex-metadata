The idea behind the work was to question the nature and limits of art. My critical homage aims to question the limits of art, presenting an object that represents Manzoni's feces and also the history of classical sculpture, through the use of bronze. Bronze is plated with gold to talk about the superficiality of economic valuation in art.","tags":["PhilosophicalArt","CriticalArt","Homage","PieroManzoni","Photo-Sculpture"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmYVU6SrwGPBzBHK4tdPUaLsNg82p414JWbp1XRhDrrbbq"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYVU6SrwGPBzBHK4tdPUaLsNg82p414JWbp1XRhDrrbbq","display_uri":"ipfs://QmPvWumwPGHYFCaCBTuKuq5GPTvDjSM7xDcsqN1YnhtVk4","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

There was a really old Italian lady that was there early in the morning arranging things. Her sons ran it and you could get deals like a dozen eggs for a dollar and fresh fruit. It really is sad to see family run things like this just vanish from places like New York, Boston and everywhere else.","tags":["MIKEBASDEN"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmWbuViAZMCFpHL65TZEWPUzako91HsQEE3JhCAc8BUXm2"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWbuViAZMCFpHL65TZEWPUzako91HsQEE3JhCAc8BUXm2","display_uri":"ipfs://QmcJNbbT6XbEsehFen8eY6waMWyWGADvVsA4YzxXw68KCp","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

{"name": "Binary Star", "description": "In 2005 I took a series of photos in very low light with long (several-second) exposures, primarily of brightly-colored items in my friend's apartment downtown Chicago. I punched up the contrast and exposure a bit in post. These abstract expressionist photo \"paintings\" were my favorite of the set. This was two images stacked in post, but the rest remain structurally intact", "tags": ["photo", "photography", "abstract", "abstractexpressionist", "expressionism", "colorfield"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmdhdWyTTPVXnwrBmRj8fap1SP9ah3qVtfzAuYr5UNpbDn", "displayUri": "ipfs://Qmdiv2Gabb1TzNTvkCWngsiwN4UJMpfWPtQZuWZJDDLDGZ", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1VuaZh9X3i1X52Tj154EzYB6qMBVNuTuDe"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdhdWyTTPVXnwrBmRj8fap1SP9ah3qVtfzAuYr5UNpbDn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

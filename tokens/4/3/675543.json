Shinichi took the appearance of his six or seven-year-old self after being exposed to a prototype poison called APTX 4869, which he had been forced to swallow by two men in black later revealed to be members of the Black Organization.[4] The poison de-aged Shinichi's entire body except for his nervous system and therefore he still has the personality, memories, and incredible deductive ability of his teenage self. PapaBears's goal is to hunt down the Black Organization and have them arrested for their crimes, as well as find an antidote to the APTX 4869. To do so he plans to make the washout detective Kogoro Mouri famous in hopes of attracting cases related to the Black Organization.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdsWjW1XM5JSJEA11sp8YPf6kjjAt7wSucUfqi8WkysjJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeacpeDSas1Dfb25SMEccFdY8hPsWKke8VtFsCQzt6Pwn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdsWjW1XM5JSJEA11sp8YPf6kjjAt7wSucUfqi8WkysjJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hhqYJd4SifMphmLN7CnvnotrkHuhho7pd"], "tags": ["Manga", "conanedogawa", "conan", "illustration", "comic", "Papaabears", "doodleart", "anime", "art", "japaneseart", "japanese", "design", "character", "2d"], "extra": {}}

One of the unknown objects is an orb that gives off energy generated from tides such as electrical energy. Tidal energy is a type of renewable energy whose numbers are relatively more predictable compared to wind energy and solar energy. Its utilization has not been widespread because from high initial costs and a limited location with sufficient tide. Further research and development is being carried out to improve efficiency and the critical limit of the energy it produces are varied a method obtained for extracting this type of energy.  important notes! The orbs are guarded by several unidentified creatures","tags":["MrKinur","Art","2D","3D","Art","Illustration","Animation","Space","UnknownObject","Limited",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmXoyjEfYpH1syMDUhbYuUKKmjQT7pgjN4ZwUpwCzQT1Tv"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXoyjEfYpH1syMDUhbYuUKKmjQT7pgjN4ZwUpwCzQT1Tv","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXzjMy57YGe1z6GU41ziQ7EEwhcWFPhThJnR2TPYFHaae","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

In the East Asian philosophy on aesthetics of ink and wash painting, the aim was not simply to reproduce the appearance of the subject, but to capture its spirit. In the same manner, the work carries some characteristics of later Western art movements, specifically Impressionism, with the emphasis on a depiction of the changing qualities of light and movement as a crucial element of human consciousness. In Unclaimed Landscapes, the sense of the sublime from a human perspective is synthesized together with the movement and transience of the mountains and the earth.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ3uetqGYdymg9nWmGcm9HGpzd7ofvYtmmDPgsTewM9oX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSDsNE3PUXjCQupmQ69RC5MTwaqEHdXxTC96wwJYZm7oM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ3uetqGYdymg9nWmGcm9HGpzd7ofvYtmmDPgsTewM9oX", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Yupp82eDiRrLcMnr3abMVM8BdAFX9jEkE"], "tags": ["Generative", "Chinese", "Landscape", "Noise"], "extra": {}}

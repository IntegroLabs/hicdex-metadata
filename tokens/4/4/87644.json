Every artwork in the serie includes my raw thoughts and emotions that I had in different situations over the last few months. They are as I wrote them. Some of the messages express things I felt then, some are still available. Take all this serie as it is. Feel free to empathise with my work and to explore a part of me. I'm grateful for all that happened. I thought I've lost myself. I was a fool. . Wish you the best. Be kind, not selfish like I was.","tags":["darkart","illustration","digital","fdbones","raw"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmXGgeZaFMVj8AgY6rZwRrV2mzsstaqzVFy2tEsHCBGFdg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXGgeZaFMVj8AgY6rZwRrV2mzsstaqzVFy2tEsHCBGFdg","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

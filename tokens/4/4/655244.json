Joe Rogan told me that this is something that would never have happened, and our president told me that I'd be financially fine! I'M NOT FINE, I WAS ABOUT TO FLIP HIM FOR 30K ETH BUT NOW I CAN'T, THE BLOCKCHAIN HAS BEEN INFECTED AND HIS CODE HAS GOTTEN CORRUPTED! \n\n-----\n\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied. Black frames are initially given out for free on Hicetnunc (or now called Teia whenever it properly gets renamed), although this frame being that this is an unusual event will only have black frames and one diamond frame later on. All artworks will be compatible within the Gallery Gehenna Game with each artwork unlocking a playable story segment.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ3mb6dahuQSp4iX8fDZxwjDwbqbkWwQ8k1LbuVN9BAKd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ3mb6dahuQSp4iX8fDZxwjDwbqbkWwQ8k1LbuVN9BAKd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ3mb6dahuQSp4iX8fDZxwjDwbqbkWwQ8k1LbuVN9BAKd", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2KTcdaM1hm8d8K9pnBu6dsD6v38bjyXDAP"], "tags": ["NeuralNetwork", "NeuralArt", "AIArt", "AIEnhancedArtOHMYGODCORONAVIRUSHELPME", "CRYPTOPUNK", "VIRUS", "HELPIMDYING", "GalleryGehenna", "GalleryGehennaNFT", "GalleryGehennaProject", "Diamond", "DiamondFrame", "GoldFrame", "BlackFrame", "WhiteFrame", "Utility", "Game"], "extra": {}}

A dream that is painted by the echoes of all the other good memories it brushes shoulders with, as you pull it to the forefront of your minds eye. Baring only the aura of what such a memory represents to you, we unknowingly peak into the abstract byproduct of our minds grapple with times illusionary state, and inherently, our uncomprehensible relationship within it.. A divine play between what was and what is, to which we are forever embedded as its entranced audience.","tags":["abstract","35mm","film","photography","flowers","landscape","multipleexposure","doubleexposure","art","dream","memories","time","illusion","claifornia","sanfrancisco","nostalgia","ghost","vintage","winslo","outdoors","botanical","hiking","grain","emotion",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmNmK72R6ny8WKtFejqoenm461hBwEY4AJNHeBS7FygxN5"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNmK72R6ny8WKtFejqoenm461hBwEY4AJNHeBS7FygxN5","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

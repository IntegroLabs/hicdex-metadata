The same value as in 2007 right before the crash. We are up and running at 568.000.000 shares and $639.000.000.000.000 in assets. Obviously riding on two horses, drunk and rich or/and sober and rich. REDRUM is all failures in one move. A drink to get drunk and poor which is rich – and or both nor neither – All at the same time always never again. Lehman Brothers are infiltrating failure with failure, ending the apocalypse, drunk driving mad maxing - the fiasco in more than full speed. Drawing on the link between liquor and celebration of value – even as celebration of literature and as a great drink – ecstacy and euphoria – defines our highest value of western society.","tags":["whitepaper","lehmanbrothers","redrom"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"application/pdf","uri":"ipfs://QmYZUEppKr9DMPqQ2w4uQPk1ZMTjKx1v6gdQ3vyDdt2jyi"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYZUEppKr9DMPqQ2w4uQPk1ZMTjKx1v6gdQ3vyDdt2jyi","display_uri":"ipfs://Qmd72thyDgDE3pWur7NNkfyzPXpdrzrDLwxxxbw7Jx2PUc","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

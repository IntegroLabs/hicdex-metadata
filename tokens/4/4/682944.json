Is it ok to recognize the good in your life knowing others are experiencing major life changing challenges?\n\nGratitude is an important and powerful energy that we must harness the most when there are challenges.\n\nPeace and love shine the light that drives out the darkness of fear. Those who are not directly involved in the crises can still help by increasing the energy of peace and love in the world.\n\nFind whatever light you can in your life, no matter where you are, and amplify it to the best of your ability.\n\nToday I feel gratitude for the warmth of my home and the safety of my family.

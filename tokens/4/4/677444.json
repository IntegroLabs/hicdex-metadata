This demon is only formed from a head without a body.  Once upon a time he wanted to drink water from Tirta Amertha (water of eternal life), even though this water was only for gods and goddesses.  Dewi Ratih who knew about this told the god Vishnu, who then threw the disc and beheaded the demon.  But at that time the head up to the neck touched Tirta Amertha, so that he could live eternally.  The chief then wanted to take revenge on the goddess Ratih and chased her in heaven.  Sometimes the goddess Ratih was caught and according to this myth there was a lunar eclipse.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYe3ErCsRXbR9jK1WgNufacrNAd9AyWcJjjQvsV3mQ1h9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWwkmbTSLhMvhvvPexb6una2ZjNYvqxBjpLCoARUMZpwS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYe3ErCsRXbR9jK1WgNufacrNAd9AyWcJjjQvsV3mQ1h9", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2FbJ6wm38MLnpoQzajkGDxJ2kML4HSc8XU"], "tags": ["Fineart", "artwork", "collection", "artis", "illustration", "culture", ""], "extra": {}}

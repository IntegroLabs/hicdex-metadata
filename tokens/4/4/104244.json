Now, half a century later, as I share these in a digital marketplace full of artists hawking their wares, I hope these photos remind us all of the humanity behind the transactions. This photo was taken along a road in Singapore, circa 1969.","tags":["photo","photography","vietnam","singapore","1969"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmdzr72CX7U6ikF4CAnFxdwcUpfepPzAoxuTU1m3qQVzSB"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmdzr72CX7U6ikF4CAnFxdwcUpfepPzAoxuTU1m3qQVzSB","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVh9w6NPxEf7HfwuaxhjzKD7Lynq9p6sLF2xPCAZ7afoW","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

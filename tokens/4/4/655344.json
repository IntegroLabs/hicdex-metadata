She stated that the abdominal pain came usually at night or during temper tantrums. This was John\u2019s third clinic visit for the same complaint, although findings of his physical examination and his laboratory test results were normal. During the visit, the doctor noticed that Sara frequently yelled at, scolded, and berated John, saying he was a \u201cbad boy and very stubborn,\u201d sometimes grabbing him forcefully or speaking loudly when he wanted to talk or move around the room. She told the doctor that the day-care worker had told her that John was aggressive at day care, with frequent \u201cmeltdowns\u201d and fighting with his peers.\"\n\n\n\nPayback is a bitch.

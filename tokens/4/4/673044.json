All of us have had some kinda trauma or pain in our life. That's just the way life is and we all also find ways to cope, mask or suppress that pain. I've been lucky that in my lifetime I haven't been forced to go to war. My father was drafted into the Air Force for the Vietnam War but he is color blind and failed a basic color test that potential pilots had to take, and he was sent home. I likely wouldn't have been born if he had actually had to serve so I'd say I'm grateful. So really anything my generation has had to deal with is really nothing compared to what our parents and grandparents had to go through to provide for what we all now have.

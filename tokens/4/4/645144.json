This Collection I present to the NFT Community as a tribute to Siddhartha Gautama Buddha and as the first collection of the Temple Of Consciousness Virtual Gallery, a reunion of different cultures and religious traditions in the crypto universe. As an multimedia artist my wish is to share the ineffable that inhabits my mind with image and sound. \nThis piece is a 2D animation video made in a digital painting process with original acoustic soundtrack lasting 18 seconds. I hope you like it!

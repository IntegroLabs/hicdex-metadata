Each day that I make a new piece I strive more and more to try and make pieces that are new and different from the day before, AND something that can be used as an interesting PFP image as well. So this piece is an exploration into creating a composition that has several different sections that could fit nicely into the cropped PFP circle. If you look around at peoples images on Twitter and Discord the majority of them are literal characters so I'm really interested in developing a new and additional function for my graphic collage pieces. Whether people can connect with a specific cropping of the piece enough to make it their visual identity is yet to be determined.

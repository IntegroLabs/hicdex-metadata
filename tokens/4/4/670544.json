The plant signifies beginnings, growth, eco friendliness, and the concept of nurturing what we love.\n\nSleepyGhost is a pixel artist and musician from Los Angeles who loves the 8bit aesthetic and making people feel nostalgia from their experimental creations.\n\n\"I\u2019ve loved the look of \u201cpixel art\u201d before I even knew that term, since a ton of games I played as a kid were made with pixel art. My most fond games of that era were probably Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening and Pokemon Silver. I remember wanting to be a game developer as a kid (and an NBA player), and make grand RPGs like those, but those plans got derailed for other interests later in my life.\" - SleepyGhost", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbvrjMgMzA8Qt2wmcEvg4k69vg3UcWfxmUFhjEzgg2vtL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZpUzjK5NS1oWCkQPYjf3RMbdi8uiDESdAGPGvvr21pun", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbvrjMgMzA8Qt2wmcEvg4k69vg3UcWfxmUFhjEzgg2vtL", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YEYsb7nCUZXvVmGe3KDUECc7TR8DE8QUd"], "tags": ["pixel", "pixelart", "gif", "plant", "gather", "gatherart", "sleepy", "sleepyghost", "8bit", "music"], "extra": {}}

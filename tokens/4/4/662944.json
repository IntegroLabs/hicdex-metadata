Piloted by U.S. Air Force Capt. Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager, the X-1 reached a speed of 1,127 kilometers (700 miles) per hour, Mach 1.06, at an altitude of 13,000 meters (43,000 feet). Yeager named the airplane \"Glamorous Glennis\" in tribute to his wife.\n\nAir-launched at an altitude of 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) from the bomb bay of a Boeing B-29, the X-1 used its rocket engine to climb to its test altitude. It flew a total of 78 times, and on March 26, 1948, with Yeager at the controls, it attained a speed of 1,540 kilometers (957 miles) per hour, Mach 1.45, at an altitude of 21,900 meters (71,900 feet). This was the highest velocity and altitude reached by a manned airplane up to that time.\n\n\nMaterials: Aluminum, radium paint\nDimensions:\nOther: 10 ft. 8 1/2 in. \u00d7 30 ft. 9 in. \u00d7 28 ft., 2780.5kg (326.4 \u00d7 937.3 \u00d7 853.4cm, 6130lb.)\n\nLocation\nNational Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXaZT2hnQSzbpNsbGSsDtYJMeumrDPv9UT8oohZthJD82", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVofwgwV66L8iyd87AN23HdqLnbLQmzQ8DD1QzpYEaHgZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXaZT2hnQSzbpNsbGSsDtYJMeumrDPv9UT8oohZthJD82", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1Z9ViyeZPU1WMQ4bXRnW2ed7DbZE63pjyB"], "tags": ["plane"], "extra": {}}

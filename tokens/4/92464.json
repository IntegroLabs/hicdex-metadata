Collect all three and receive a high resolution file of the whole painting sent to your collection.  \"This Creature is your Neighbor\" was inspired by the surrealist architecture of Edward James that he built in Xilitla, Mexico.  He said they were made to house his dreams.  The idea of creating a physical space to shelter and protect non-physical phenomena fascinated me.  This is common practice in many religions (cathedrals, shrines, altars), but artists also have studios, sketchbooks, even a program file can become a safehouse where one disengages from one realm in order to connect with another. I will mint 5 copies of each piece, and 15 of the whole painting as an unlockable..", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQWaaS3HZFXXQwcEVH2MCaW7ZGf8SjtaNriXhgfum4Wop", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1ZmQG4TgB5gvWduuWKTSpak6oyST8B67C2"], "tags": ["painting", "collectible", "collection", "digital", "objkt", "captainmcsweeney", "scifi"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/png", "uri": "ipfs://QmQWaaS3HZFXXQwcEVH2MCaW7ZGf8SjtaNriXhgfum4Wop"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmZWajhBbnD2xQhS327byJTFk1j7BYT7PXcAFaLm3B3XBq"}, "supply": "5", "transfered": 5}

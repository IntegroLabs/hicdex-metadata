Through the extreme fragmentation of her body, Seeger consciously plays with the notion of collectability. The collector of this work can now acquire a terrain or fragment of the artist and thus, own her. The material and immaterial identity is crushed, distributed and circulated until it develops a life of its own. The owner also becomes a part of Seeger's terrain.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmP5UXfDbo8UqYh4MshPV7ZTidKhze2YV8D9xtX233i9re","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1T3jFZid8J2Qo8V1h8Sg9LwVYxLYQZXzut"],"tags":["1280×720","01:29","Stereo","edition/3+1AP"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmP5UXfDbo8UqYh4MshPV7ZTidKhze2YV8D9xtX233i9re"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmQ5Z3aXCCBe9q7pXvTVbrk1DjktwNT9XX47DPb7c3rv7t"},"supply":"4","transfered":3}

It is my hope that they will appear simultaneously familiar, and yet completely alien.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZqLYEcxevHFM7Ds2TDDUJirUdvXAST8sYssRuMvxx762","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmZqLYEcxevHFM7Ds2TDDUJirUdvXAST8sYssRuMvxx762"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmW8Mxvzo7XE3jFwWV6xGenbSiWqmMZN8yJo7nZw4qpmfy"},"supply":"3","transfered":4}

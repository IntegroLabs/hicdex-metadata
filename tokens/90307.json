The Safe Zone is driven out from the dark era of the artist\u2019s life when he was struggling with the addiction problem. A passive period that isolated the artist in his safe corner, a period that was just a consumption, without any action.  This lived experience was an inspiration for the artist to extend his encounter toward the world, to a large part of contemporary societies. Societies that do not act, have no action and only consume in their safe zone, in corners of their home.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR1uKLYCTeWPsjenTHPUDoqaeDZdSmJotpuXuZM4zJSxj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1YhD7kdTm5dLc14sfFM1CJpfZV1iKbFbYj"], "tags": ["digitalpainting", "figurative", "darkart", "creepy"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmR1uKLYCTeWPsjenTHPUDoqaeDZdSmJotpuXuZM4zJSxj"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmZkmnDukSgDuksNE5gihD4aPviP76qpEVeKUfTGePfXre"}, "supply": "5", "transfered": 14}

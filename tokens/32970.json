This digital painting is part of my series \"Thresholds\" where I create works partly through a GAN and my own computerized brush strokes. I use the word 'threshold' for my series as it can be a boundary or a starting point of an experience. I like its connection to the words 'thresh,'  meaning \"to separate seed from a plant using a machine \" and 'thrash,' meaning \"to beat soundly or go over again and again.\"","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPMxEzXkVRYkd7GgDAn9SdBbH3fK38bzjksVyRgiKco9y","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1gi6oobJHp9ZvUgW2p4WKHKysFdxEMQanB"],"tags":["thresholds","painting","digital","ganart","fineart","abstract","travisleroy"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmPMxEzXkVRYkd7GgDAn9SdBbH3fK38bzjksVyRgiKco9y"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmSYjJ28UD1DYZ7NvBnN8pXZWXnTpneVKPHhXhuia6Rs4a"},"supply":"3","transfered":3}

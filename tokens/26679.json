The composed soundtrack is a counterpoint to the humour of the visual. There are oblique references to emissions, greenhouse gases and NFT energy consumption. The piece has surreal nostalgia linked to the 1990s electronic music scene in the U.K.,where ravers would travel long distances to attend illegal raves in the countryside.  These temporary freedoms of movement and expression were clamped down upon by the Tory government.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmahq6qWU9WXeaQ7fjb5fCWHWaKhVKFHDQgL4CSV9YU66c","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://Qmahq6qWU9WXeaQ7fjb5fCWHWaKhVKFHDQgL4CSV9YU66c"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmUvV6oQifKtGsarhw8QmzoEcMcfSLqc5eAzvC7AEihGPc"},"supply":"1","transfered":1}

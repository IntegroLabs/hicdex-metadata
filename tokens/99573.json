This specific weekend Toronto was hosting a mix of celebrities, athletes, and musicians for some of the biggest events. During a private afterparty I was approached by Lebron's Manager and told \"He doesn't normal let people take pictures of him, but he has asked if you could shoot a few for him\". The view down the lenses of my camera is one that I will never forget, it was almost as if I was face to face with a cardboard cut out, instead it was the legend himself. - Gabriel Di Sante", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfRnTfrWQEfgnFHNN4YVXqKgH24MQ7CjHKSwH3X9FK18K", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbBxBcwXx3dCeqeb7d6jSZagXo1kgeAcoYz14dCUDH3DH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1cvkGoM12RFWyutnrW9k45GFBsFwBkKZR9"], "tags": ["nba", "nbastar", "celebrities", "toronto", "torontophotographer", "lebron", "Lebronjames", "lakers"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmfRnTfrWQEfgnFHNN4YVXqKgH24MQ7CjHKSwH3X9FK18K"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmNcKkhMQKNJV2Xce4sMHAwxosVxTLuGQZMm539xAwU7TY"}, "supply": "1", "transfered": 0}

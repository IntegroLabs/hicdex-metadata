Had to fight against the surrounding islands, making their appearance with their harbor lights from far away. I stayed overexposed on the windy beach at night, on one of the only area of the island where I could catch some darkness. It's not easy to find in the very mountainous Sifnos. You can see the lights of Serifos appearing far away and exposing the horizon.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSJB3UYtBdPtEDy23UzLBkXrCQ4pLk55VhcbcjwAMWgUK","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1cNbCn2aC3HjHR9GCjHDYK2kYsL7QkDmyG"],"tags":["Sifnos","Greece","Travel","glitch","art","NFT","dark","exposure","long","trails","stars","astrophotography","photograph","shadow","black","and","white","monochrome","astral","space","scifi","sci-fi","photo"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmSJB3UYtBdPtEDy23UzLBkXrCQ4pLk55VhcbcjwAMWgUK"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmP8foCaiWpHM7aN4iUxMtSA8d7UP4Q2uuyPxpbE8UmD4n"},"supply":"50","transfered":209}

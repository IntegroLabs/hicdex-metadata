Each piece shows a different social order between the birds. The birds show their differences and their similarities. Even the position of the bird determines the social relations. The backside of the bird says something to which \"family\" the bird belongs and the front says something to whom the bird is attracted. Have fun understanding the complex relationships of these little birds.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcRXSMTztz5o5ZipWYg3AA4PfKLVZq5NagZEKEieNBRxj","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmcRXSMTztz5o5ZipWYg3AA4PfKLVZq5NagZEKEieNBRxj"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmdxsFaXpwxFZarwhtsULpqsj6DPoREMATGvGTvBFYu1oo"},"supply":"20","transfered":20}

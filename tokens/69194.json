The seed points are those that enter cycles under the orbit function within 16,384 steps. You can actually stare at a point watch it go through its entire cycle (although there are many exclusive cycles, so a single point will not traverse the entire image). The polar distortion for this object is (r^0.9, θ*1.23 φ*1.23). @BruceKnowsHow","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTfXkKxTvPtUtBPqLVFqzkdsqVoxeYnsHiW6z5PkwiYCW","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1Z1knHP2DbNQNs4DWJuMDv6EwbC8QFBWfr"],"tags":["Generative","Abstract","Render","3D","Fractal","Loop","Procedural","Video"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmTfXkKxTvPtUtBPqLVFqzkdsqVoxeYnsHiW6z5PkwiYCW"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmPjBgYqzYgT9swcmEuDS2yzBHCJpbQH87pXsUuJdFNy5o"},"supply":"1","transfered":2}

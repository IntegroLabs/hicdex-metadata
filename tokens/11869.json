The artist brought their laptop out into the world and placed it in a variety of natural settings, arranged a mirror so that the laptop could see its reflection, and ran code that used the laptopâ€™s webcam to take a photo of itself in the mirror.   After taking thousands of photos over several months, the laptop used the dataset it had gathered as the training data for a StyleGAN network. Using this neural network, the laptop was able to learn to generate unique self-portraits, set in a world of its own imagination.  The videos in this series are the unedited outputs of the model, documenting its progression.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSXDGTAAguyH3VL9HUB7Rqr3spa9cwtQhvkdTudvRPy39","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmSXDGTAAguyH3VL9HUB7Rqr3spa9cwtQhvkdTudvRPy39"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://Qmd77cphTdgcQnbCMEEkZ4jzPHv5kvTooVr4tEmzZ9RhmE"},"supply":"10","transfered":9}

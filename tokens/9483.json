This NFT will use the better-call.dev API to determine its own primary purchases. Every purchase raises the complexity of the rendered image a notch, reaching 100% when all 50 have been purchased. Additionally the wallets are used to hash a random seed, each additional purchase has the potential to change the image radically. The final artwork will be stable and determined by the unique set of primary buyers.  WARNING: This is a highly experimental piece and may break in the future if the API were to change.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcxsCQudxWwZHRGs7Jt6iUuDAtQvA18xAX8jgRWidZgkg","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/svg+xml","uri":"ipfs://QmcxsCQudxWwZHRGs7Jt6iUuDAtQvA18xAX8jgRWidZgkg"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmRkNjzDXR6QMioicG5gK5N8StsJMEXFgxPCKjh2kJgTba"},"supply":"50","transfered":64}

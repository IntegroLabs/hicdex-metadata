Does it move? Does it do anything? Who made it? Should I enjoy it? Everything Donut is a series of 3D objects covered in donut glaze and sprinkles, as an ode to technical reproducibility and sugar. It\u2019s digital. It\u2019s made by use a machine. It\u2019s not on a gallery. It\u2019s pink. It\u2019s been decades since Duchamp. Yet it\u2019s pretty, but is it Art?  Everything Donut - Cup is the first of the series to be minted as an NFT. It combines the artist\u2019s search for 3D realism, personal memories of her grandmother\u2019s kitchen, and the ever present pink donut glaze.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYyYYpf8xYxUNavFQZbNuiDvRLwfs1gop6qUSMutzCeNC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1Uw89oPxtBrCVopaL7Gy4DsKK9B62igfWQ"], "tags": ["3D", "realism", "render"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/png", "uri": "ipfs://QmYyYYpf8xYxUNavFQZbNuiDvRLwfs1gop6qUSMutzCeNC"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmePtxX5sUrKRoP63sE7Bs2uYQji6Fr8j8npJ4VkkTZaNN"}, "supply": "1", "transfered": 3}

I see myself in one of my favorite character in video games, Paarthurnax. He\u2019s an old dragon who has no desire left for ruling over Tamriel and fighting humans. He found wisdom by not destroying everything around him. The desire to not destroy oneself is what makes me idolized Paarthurnax. The difference between Paarthurnax and me is he learned to not destroy everything around him, while i\u2019m learning to not destroy myself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbsajKe4ngpGRyzS7L4fokZogSFvxWc1gUAdRSwUjEKgi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVpxDH2SieHrh7CeRs4EHAiVwUUviVpzfLzDLhak3dZuc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbsajKe4ngpGRyzS7L4fokZogSFvxWc1gUAdRSwUjEKgi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hkY5xSezBSoJoy2JZAqeo1qE5ZPmhu5ov"], "tags": ["Skyrim", "theeelderscrolls", "paarthurnax", "dragon"], "extra": {}}

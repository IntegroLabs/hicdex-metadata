Thousands of people died in this nuclear massacre. It still causes serious mutations on the generations that come to the world after this event. These two atrocities showed humanity that there should be no nuclear weapons, not only for humans, but for all living things. I respectfully commemorate all the people who lost their lives in these massacres.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeQDJ41YdHnR5pmYrUeMnU3dyqGfxV9jAaZ8ZoNvjhxYE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTQX9YNKATFe6j7GTg3B2HWGSvEmmYj6ihHScsCwmL6AW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeQDJ41YdHnR5pmYrUeMnU3dyqGfxV9jAaZ8ZoNvjhxYE", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1S7uCX8KyyCzfzRPr5gAMSzqEoQ3bruQCV"], "tags": ["atom", "gnsstudio", "png", "bomb", "tezos"], "extra": {}}

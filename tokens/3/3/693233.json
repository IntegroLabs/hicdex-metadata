{"__version": 1, "token_id": 693233, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "VIOLATIONS", "description": "Is it possible to create a word pyramid starting with a 3 letter word and systematically increase the letter count to 10 letters? Oh and another stipulation or parameter would be that all words MUST begin with the letters \"VI\". Is it possible? Absolutely, but it took time to get to this point. This one was a bit special in that it is not a \"traditional\" word pyramid where all words are related by having similar letters or even an anagram of a word. No, this one includes variations of similar words based on the prefix. A novel endeavor that has yielded another rare gem in the tapestry of bizarro syntax crystals. These words do not necessarily have a specific story-like narrative, but I suppose someone could make up their own. This was more of an exercise to see if I could do something within certain parameters; a challenge posed, accepted, and won!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSxE7nGdZ5zouw8amfiMueujpzPjSH1pMGtq3n8LHzMrT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPPhxZD1Aeu59rgUz37f2kbU5LLHTgLM3sRMDRCbVbJ2P", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSxE7nGdZ5zouw8amfiMueujpzPjSH1pMGtq3n8LHzMrT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

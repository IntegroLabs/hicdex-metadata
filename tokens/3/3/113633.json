When he died in 1937, the painting was offered to the Corporation of Hampstead. He specified in his will that should his bequest be refused by Hampstead, the painting was then to be offered to Coventry. The model in the painting is Mab (Mabel) Paul, an artist model and West End theatre actress who was also painted as herself by John Collier. Mab Paul was a niece of Charles Kegan Paul. I painted this on canvas in 2018 from the original painting Lady Godiva, 1897, painted by English artist John Collier, who worked in the style of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The original portrayal of Lady Godiva and her well-known ride through Coventry, England, is held in Coventry's Herbert Art Gallery and Museum.","tags":["Impressionism","DigitalArt","OilPainting"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmNQeXPxWnVjmx7Lhzok8Q2sFgWvVcPHew7PvW4YPdgy6m"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNQeXPxWnVjmx7Lhzok8Q2sFgWvVcPHew7PvW4YPdgy6m","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXjMiS3jwif7wGr86ZRwjx5YjZUUnS6H31zGaaJnxdZFV","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

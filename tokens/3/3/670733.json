When I was in undergrad as a BFA I had to take 2 years of foundational art classes including portrait and figure drawing and I used to take my sketch pad everywhere. I played Division 1 soccer for 3 years in undergrad as well and when I was taking figure drawing I would ask alot of my team mates to do 10 minute sittings. I just recently stumbled upon that sketch book and found a dozen portrait sketches that I hadn't seen in 20 years. This is my friend Vinny, he was from Ohio and we used to hang out all the time. I may not have enjoyed college nearly as much if I hadn't played soccer because it was as if I was gifted this group of friends based solely on the fact that we played soccer. The NFT space isn't so different. Whether its an artist we all like or actually having access to creators it's this common ground that is bringing us together and the space wouldn't be the same without these connections.

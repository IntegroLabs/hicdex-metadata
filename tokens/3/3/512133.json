The painfully bright lightning against a terrifyingly dark stormy sky, literally whipping off the mightiest branch of the human-like tree. It is the clouds and approaching storms. The whole thing is charged with the illusion of boundlessness as far as the horizon. Lightning just splitting a tree can be a parable for the state of the world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTtKmEksAu48Cd9eCDP1mAz3ffaGtiMmotvF3QFYU1Nrn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbZc5cyFGvBWDRJb277ST3tZxwN9669Fc1MR2hp4VBGFR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTtKmEksAu48Cd9eCDP1mAz3ffaGtiMmotvF3QFYU1Nrn", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1RQRZEToscP9yRde16XoJZubtq4fLFyyWm"], "tags": ["landscape", "tree", "painting", "lightning", "hen500k"], "extra": {}}

I would never wish ill will towards anyone, but good god will someone just lock this guy in a room somewhere for the rest of his life and throw away the key? On his very last day the itinerary for his schedule read as follows: HE WILL MAKE MANY CALLS AND HAVE MANY MEETINGS. Talk about the least creative bullshit I've ever seen. He and his \"team\" weren't even hiding how stupid they were because that's how stupid they were. I can't wait for that man and everyone around him to be thrown in jail for what they've done to the world. I tend to use my work as a way to deal with thoughts and feelings...and boy let me tell you...I have PLENTY of feelings towards THAT man.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeYdP9cu2DzJD619jLiPX5JsnDVCcQCqyYGp5VF3eRgBP", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf8YbAtyJpvAh5uqVpXhRafpzxBT9mLvTSRYfRK3NeyWT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeYdP9cu2DzJD619jLiPX5JsnDVCcQCqyYGp5VF3eRgBP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

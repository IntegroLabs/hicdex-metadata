Conversing with her private histories, memories and experiences through the inanimate \u2013 the stories which were never told while growing up, but muttered and pieced together through the family archive. The project allows me to access my feelings through abstraction, explore my relationships with the women in my family and to understand the spectrum of differences of intergenerational traditions.\n\n \n\nThrough the archive, I visit the places that are distant memories to fill the gulf through the process of fragmentation. Through machine learning, the results are temporal sprawling of frames that reimagine blurred realities. The learned imagery dives deep into the subconsciousness and consciousness to tackle the notions of inherited identities and symbolic familial connections.

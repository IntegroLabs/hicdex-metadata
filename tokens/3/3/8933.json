I originally did two drawings with the same theme. Poem depicts a man having some food and drink beneath a tree in the moonlight. You can see the original drawings on paper in my Instagram account (@nulnul7) Also check my website (https://hakanunluart.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/50th-anniversary-of-lunar-landing/) for all my space related works for the past 50 years (yes, since the actual lunar landing).

An explorer aboard the spaceship Rocinante journeys toward the black hole, believing there may be something beyond it. As he moves closer, it becomes increasingly difficult to control the ship and he is eventually drawn in by the pull of gravity, and suddenly they meet with the giant, the ancient myth, the son of the stars.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUDYNCFQhu8nMSZ3zrK2wUREkfbxebeQxrME3n2RV1rk4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbhZ6HLrAFDoagJg8UEjv1CoNwvrHEQZGa8LK9q7QqTMQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmTeguxFMkupUYaEJWXj8o7AwmF8Dmhi48ez8vVfKHQrVS", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUDYNCFQhu8nMSZ3zrK2wUREkfbxebeQxrME3n2RV1rk4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1P2xABvNtCb3pGjmGgn9R3xUtciB3MeGXA"], "tags": ["Digitalillustration", "digitalpainting", "ILLUSTRATION", "ARTWORK", "SPACEWOMBAT", "surrealism", "digitaldrawing", "mythology", "sciencefiction", "rush"], "extra": {}}

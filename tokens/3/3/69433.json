After I developed the negative, I deformed it. I printed the deformed negative on Iford multigrade paper. I only have 1 paper edition. This copy is the scanned of that print. It is not possible to repeat this work as I make various masking during printing on paper.","tags":["photography","bw","blackandwhite","darkroom","experimental"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmbx7NVTc3pWGWo95WoJEJDMDAaMqsQXHTKPfNVDkxnAvD"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmbx7NVTc3pWGWo95WoJEJDMDAaMqsQXHTKPfNVDkxnAvD","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

You\u2019ll recognize it by the 2 fainter stars on either side of it. \n\n\n\nThe name Altair is Arabic in origin and has the same meaning as the name of the constellation Aquila in Latin; that is, they both mean simply \u201ceagle.\u201d In classical mythology Aquila, and by extension Altair as well, was an eagle favored by Zeus. He played a part in numerous myths, including the abduction of Ganymede in which Aquila carries off a young boy (Ganymede) to Mount Olympus on Zeus\u2019 command to become the cupbearer to the gods. In another myth Aquila is the eagle that torments Prometheus, until Hercules shoots it with poisoned arrows.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVZCts6EXK8iXR8Wmv85maquWyrxYjP2CdugaoQ52oHEb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVZCts6EXK8iXR8Wmv85maquWyrxYjP2CdugaoQ52oHEb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmVZCts6EXK8iXR8Wmv85maquWyrxYjP2CdugaoQ52oHEb", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVZCts6EXK8iXR8Wmv85maquWyrxYjP2CdugaoQ52oHEb", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1REcHdezPw17S5bP6VK6YXK5NweJNsf41i"], "tags": ["GIF", "colorful", "illustration", "girl", "womenart", "star", "constellation", "myth", "greekmyth"], "extra": {}}

But to be honest, most of the time it's random. Here I grabbed the moment when Neo use an iron bar to fight the infinite Smiths. Impossible fight for him?

Cause the environment builds the moment, in any way. hmmm I don't know where I go with this thought, now you have it. I want my NFTs to be some \"mantra\" or thoughts, I feel pure art for art is a bit of a waste of time hmmm don't u think ?\"\n\n\u00b0\u00a4*(\u00af\u00b4\u2605`\u00af)*\u00a4\u00b0\u2022\n\nA \uff4d \uff42\uff45\uff52\uff53\u2591\uff4f\uff46\u2591\uff54\uff48\uff45\u2591\uff32\uff45\uff41\uff4c\uff54\uff49\uff4d\uff45 \u301052-80\u3011 \ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude14\ud835\ude09\ud835\ude19\ud835\ude0c \ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude10\ud835\ude19\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude0c \ud835\ude34\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\n\n\u00a4\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af`\u2022\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022.\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af`\u2022\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022.\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af`\u2022\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022.\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af`\u2022\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022.\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4\u00af`\nI can produce high Res long length output of this kind of visuals, if you're interested DM me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfXhkdMgNdMvb5jqCdCdHDTbWkKPgBmYRfsBQRL6wuBEH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdurHs2E3f7QeKPNBfrJ6R1ZnQrELcYtYJ1vLVeq3ENHo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfXhkdMgNdMvb5jqCdCdHDTbWkKPgBmYRfsBQRL6wuBEH", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QFyjHEp3kfeyEuMAAcuc4oYZjmrMjn9vx"], "tags": ["matrix", "ASCII", "Realtime", "Aotr", "Ambersoftherealtime", "Touchdesigner", "3d", "art", "glitchart", "newmediaart", "reuse", "f_lse_no", "realtimemotiongraphics", "VJART", "VJ"], "extra": {}}

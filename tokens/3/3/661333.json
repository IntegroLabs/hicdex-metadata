While giving this wolf shape and color, I was also continuing to listen to the audiobook of \"Women Who Run with the Wolves\", by writer Clarissa Pinkola Est\u00e9s. I must say that I am loving this book, and that I was also pleased with the final result of my illustration, which, of course, relates in a way to the theme chosen by the author of the book to symbolize the Wild Woman archetype.\n\n\nAbout the artist\n\nHi, my name is Daniela, but you can call me Dani. I am a dreamer female artist who lives in Brazil. My biggest dream is to live through my art and my creativity, and also to help make the world a fairer place for people and animals. If all goes well, I even intend to create shelters that are cozy and heavenly for abandoned or needy animals.\nI am currently in college, studying Visual Arts. I also love writing and playing the piano. I love animals a lot, including dinosaurs and the mythical ones like dragons.\nMy Twitter account: @danihp_art\nMy Instagram art account: @dani_hp_art", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWmsqYuay9pAG4oqrXzpdy3DtsAZ2ZpVLrVpwD9WeGzJL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPA8dx7rGLnd3xfJALvwCKiL8JwnnRkXsqA1rBiKkKE5L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWmsqYuay9pAG4oqrXzpdy3DtsAZ2ZpVLrVpwD9WeGzJL", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MnL9oSz51vjrnFNt3oF3NQ6mfm6UoeSzQ"], "tags": ["wolf", "art", "colorful", "colors", "color", "animal", "wolves", "digitalart", "animals"], "extra": {}}

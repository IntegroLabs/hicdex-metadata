They are often thought to be vicious, bloodthirsty killers, but in reality, they are shy, gentle animals that play an important role in the ecosystems in which they live.\n\nWolves are highly social animals that live in packs of up to 30 animals. They use their pack to help them hunt, protect their territory, and care for their young. Wolves are very intelligent animals and have a complex social structure. They are able to communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations and body language. \n\nWolves packs are ruled by an alpha male and alpha female, one of the most common wolf couples is the mated pair. These wolves have chosen each other and are usually very close. They will often be seen hunting and playing together. They are very devoted to each other and will protect each other at all costs.\n\nDimensions: 3072x4096 Pixels\n\nTools used: GLIDE, image editor, SwinIR, GPT3", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVYAB6GN5LgbuwQhKcEhK4FVTKdpCc3DWcgAXrdFhwyFq", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qman3SRQ9HhMBXhPb1GxvWnEhbPygyNrcKQP8QnzLkrA65", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVYAB6GN5LgbuwQhKcEhK4FVTKdpCc3DWcgAXrdFhwyFq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Wcx2cHwV6u3nyJ6xcVUDxNPeefDLPdbrW"], "tags": ["Wolves", "landscape", "painting", "marriage", "love", "couple", "NFT", "art", "AILAB", "AI"], "extra": {}}

However as the fishing pontoons are floating platforms they do change their location from time to time so this distance can vary slightly. The whale sharks appear to be most common during new moon, however we have also seen them during other times of the month as well but this is less common. The local community (who will take you on these trips) will do their best to communicate with the fishermen on the pontoons so that we have the most up to date information on where the Whale Sharks are.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRhX5i52ngEShv4knwTcFjbtjyw5NcL6gSWFfVUc2z65U", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVdefMtrSm2oheoD4TqpxcGL3S5sjuPgRUSLZuoK5p4Uy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRhX5i52ngEShv4knwTcFjbtjyw5NcL6gSWFfVUc2z65U", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QanVS6UuVLHoto85pwUnGBFnxjPPLvLrV"], "tags": ["whale", "shark", "travel", "indonesia", "adventure", "animal", "ranselusang"], "extra": {}}

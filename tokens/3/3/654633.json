We laud the winner and spurn the losers. Life shouldn't be seen as competition, it should be seen as a multi-generational cooperation towards pure enlightenment.

Towards ending death? And towards so many other topics. What would happen if we collectively all put down our weapons and lifted up our arms? What kind of world would we live in? Call it narrow-minded, na\u00efve, nitwit nascent nostalgia. It's fine, I don't mind being called names; names are just made up words, just like this sentence.

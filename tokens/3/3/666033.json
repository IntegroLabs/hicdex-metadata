It is both a natural function and an engineered concept that satisfies various social requirements and is filled with certain standards towards the mother and her behavior.\nThe desire to meet the criteria of the ideal, high social expectations and discrimination are strong oppressive factors, pushing the sensory knowledge of the process into the background. All this puts women who have taken on new experiences in a position of particular fragility and vulnerability.\nPublic breastfeeding is a very controversial topic in the practice of motherhood. Feeding a baby in a cafe , museum or any other public space is often accompanied by social judgment and accusations of shamelessness.\nI use breast milk as invisible ink and paint recognizable images of mothers. Thus, focusing on the duality in relation to mothers - the exaltation of the image in culture and censure in everyday life.\n\nGIF, 600*824, 42 frames\nbreast milk on silk\n2022", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQA9pPVVPeu2tcCMWN72Nfgebji9aFsL2Hmuuh5AgCbV3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQA9pPVVPeu2tcCMWN72Nfgebji9aFsL2Hmuuh5AgCbV3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQA9pPVVPeu2tcCMWN72Nfgebji9aFsL2Hmuuh5AgCbV3", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1MAL4Z1LBwop5wQQuFcmxt4uP4bwPm7Qu4"], "tags": ["white", "breast", "madonna", "silk", "breast-feeding", "milk", "motherhood"], "extra": {}}

It was shot by me in Jo\u00e3o Pessoa-Brazil in 2015 at a queer party called Kika. This party no longer exists and for this reason this is what I am calling an \"archive and feelings\". I will develop this concept better in my nexts series.\n\n\n25% of sales will be passed on to her.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT9DC5pZybfvpp24AzGy4YqsUUhrsRWXnmiG7q36qNvSv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT9DC5pZybfvpp24AzGy4YqsUUhrsRWXnmiG7q36qNvSv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT9DC5pZybfvpp24AzGy4YqsUUhrsRWXnmiG7q36qNvSv", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1d2dxDa1pyQ7ivxfKpbGNyJxePY3pGN1XC"], "tags": ["glitc", "glitchart", "queer", "videoart"], "extra": {}}

(https://linktr.ee/arte_mateus)    -     On September 25, 1987, 18 cans similar to those found in supermarkets were found floating near the coast of the municipality of Maricá, in Rio de Janeiro, about 60 miles from the capital. Frightened after opening some of them, the local fishermen delivered the shipment to the Military Police. As it turned out, each contained approximately 1.5 kg of marijuana. It would be the first official record of the episode that would go down in history as the \"summer of the tin\" In late August, the Federal Police of Rio received a US statement that the Solana Star ship, which was coming from Australia, was off the coast of Rio de Janeiro carrying 22 tons of marijuana, which would later be transferred to two other boats destined for to Miami. The crew discovered that the boat was being searched for and dumped its entire arsenal into the sea. Around September 20, several cans began to be found on the coast of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.","tags":["NFTcollectibles","NFTCommunity","nftcollectors","nftart","nftclean","CleanNFT","digitalart","DigitalArtist","tezosnft","cryptoart","NFT","nftcollection","nftcollector","NFTdrop","nftartist","nftartwork","MINT","NEWMINT","DROP","NEWDROP","ARTWORK","ARTEMATEUS","PHOTOSHOP","collectibles","collectors","collection","collector","BESTNFT","GALLERY","famous","hDAO","TOKEN","RANDOM","OBJKT","JPEG","CLASSIC","MATEUS","MATEUS.SEM.AGA","MATEUSSEMAGA","BR","BRAZIL"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmQG7RECykXTLADR1ivoEqbgSpmt8c9ShGGcnfgjw4iGTh","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQG7RECykXTLADR1ivoEqbgSpmt8c9ShGGcnfgjw4iGTh","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZkVB2NdjAn8Ge4c22SGvuv68WB8vS3X4PzE7zUKdyiz5","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

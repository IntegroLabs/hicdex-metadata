{"__version": 1, "token_id": 642833, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Killer Queen (blueprint)", "description": "She keeps her Moet et Chandon in her pretty cabinet. \"Let them eat cake\", she says, just like Marie Antoinette. A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy, at anytime an invitation you can't decline. Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette, extraordinarily nice. She's a Killer Queen. \n\nTo avoid complications, she never kept the same address. In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness. Met a man from China, went down to Asia Minor. Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined. Perfume came naturally from Paris. For cars she couldn't care less, fastidious and precise. She's a Killer Queen.\n\nDrop of a hat she's as willing as playful as a pussy cat, then momentarily out of action, temporarily out of gas, to absolutely drive you wild. She's all out to get you. She's a Killer Queen\n\n[Lyrics from The Killer Queen - Queen]\n\n[Pictures are from Unsplash]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNxQ49gxbMdkZXaXK4ZR8t8ko7QpvRJfkTTkU8vZvJK8b", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUuoPrv783YG5Zb4P5U3RvhpXHQMNJMmaQk3KuBtvnAMW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNxQ49gxbMdkZXaXK4ZR8t8ko7QpvRJfkTTkU8vZvJK8b", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fjbie4J87iS7Gw5XZonMbZTL5gjr9oYLJ"], "tags": ["queen", "killerqueen", "thekillerqueen", "freddiemercury", "nft", "art", "digitalcollage", "collage", "minimalcollage", "minimal"], "extra": {}}

Here, we see the artist experiment with the relationship between bold physical gesture and mark making. She makes broad, sweeping movements over a ground of smaller, clustered gestures that even preserve fingerprints in places. The colors of the piece, building up from pinks with blues that culminate in a deep purple, are a direct result of the physical engagement with the work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUFAWagWZystaBRD1dfziePfngXnn6NhwKjmbzCTU2Y4i", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfM1fMVHSiaTz32CzEE13qn1tjqq7YCyAbXmJkeEheSom", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUFAWagWZystaBRD1dfziePfngXnn6NhwKjmbzCTU2Y4i", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MfoQk4kryZJJyYA2wnYnd1mhUGLoi4XQv"], "tags": ["toddler", "kid", "baby", "fingerpainting", "youngemergingartist", "youngemergingfemaleartist", "femaleartist", "toddlergan", "toddler"], "extra": {}}

Every pixel art piece will involve everyones favorite coin, which most certainly is Tezos. Great White sharks are one of my favorite animals. There's so much mystery surrounding their activity and they are so terrifying. Growing up in the 80's, me and my mom would sometimes visit Cape Cod for a day at the beach. I used to swim in the Atlantic with confidence, but there was always an underlying fear of what could be lurking below. Since 2012 there have been two fatal attacks in Massachusetts waters.

She embodies beauty and strength and is the patron deity of combat, war, revolution, and the night. Mayari is the eldest daughter of Bathala and is known as the most beautiful deity in the heavenly court. When Bathala fell into a deep slumber, Mayari fought her brother, Apolaki - the God of War, for dominion over the Earth. Their fierce battle ended when Mayari lost one eye. The sibling war gods formed a truce, with Apolaki ruling during the day, and Mayari claiming dominion over the the Earth once it is shrouded by Night.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQr2RoYG2yE5yr8Y9QmmVxpN5kbg8jnY9PfrRFLNR9k1C", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTvEe6Z16w1bmsAKvqHDXgV4ihg1iZMB2yQS3nx9emLEU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQr2RoYG2yE5yr8Y9QmmVxpN5kbg8jnY9PfrRFLNR9k1C", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Q3dc9cujebXdjjRuczGegfZsQAbTHEEML"], "tags": ["mayari", "goddess", "god", "moon", "aswang", "mythology", "myth", "creature", "cryptid", "philippines", "filipino", "pinoy", "illustration"], "extra": {}}

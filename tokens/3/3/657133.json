Ever notice that if you take the word HATRED and make an anagram of it that it spells RED HAT? Coincidence? Possibly? But now and for ever and ever you can't unsee it. Not only do these red hats in real life represent the worst of America, but the actual word red hat literally spells out hatred. You honestly can't make this stuff up folks. The English language is an oracle of which I've never seen another language quite like it. But I digress. So we have what looks like a simple fractional equation. (RED HAT / HATRED = 1) Because all the letters are the same and are just rearranged, we can say that they both equal the same thing, which is each other, ergo (1/1 = 1) Coincidence?

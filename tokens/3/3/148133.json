A group of thrill seekers known as \"Dopamine Freaks\" are always looking for new ways of getting their fix. There are a handful of underground labs hidden deep into the slums of the city that offer exactly what they are in search of. Machines that deliver dopamine straight to their brain in volumes not bearable by any normal human being. The ultimate result is pleasant death, due to the sheer overdose of dopamine, frying their brain inside out. That is what the restrains are for, so they can't change their mind at the very last second. But no one ever does, because this is what they want, this is what they search for, this is what they die for.. for that one last fix of dopamine.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT6LjxQYmnqUBTdoCWwnKy9rnsz4tbqQjPo8LfeK7ikV1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS6kGvswKvH9j5ZtqVzd9QcvHmnxzRcvk7KNASEz9bBke", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT6LjxQYmnqUBTdoCWwnKy9rnsz4tbqQjPo8LfeK7ikV1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YWuRGjN8Z74svbjh2bLK2Dp6H3yDXMw1e"], "tags": ["sci-fi", "sciencefiction", "scifi", "dark", "future", "3d", "render", "octane", "dystopian", "instagram", "socialmedia", "addiction", "likes", "cables", "cyberpunk", "rolzay", "machine", "drugs"], "extra": {}}

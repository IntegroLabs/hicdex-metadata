The Pieta typically depicts the Virgin Mary embracing her son Jesus Christ after his recent death.  The Pieta depicts a mother figure's anguish after losing her son--and this son being the messiah, hope for humanity. This modern day version depicts a woman (Lala Drona) holding herself. \"The modern day Pieta would be each and everyone of us holding ourselves\" said Lala Drona.

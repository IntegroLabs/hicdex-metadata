Depending on the context sticking out your tongue can mean many things. Some even cary their heart on the tongue...depending on what you say the tongue is either soft like a feather or sharp as a knife that cuts deep. The tongue also is your taste and can bring you joy or disgust with just a single drop. Embrace your tongue!

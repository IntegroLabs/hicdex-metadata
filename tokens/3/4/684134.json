I spent the last day and a half in Cincinnati, Ohio for an NFT event. Cinci is right across the Ohio river from Kentucky but is still almost 2 hours from Louisville. So it's actually really close but not close enought to pop over there just any time so I really had no volume of photos to attempt to make a piece let alone 2 based on the city. So when I wasn't meeting lots of new people interested in NFTs I was out walking around taking photos and I just happened to be staying directly next to the baseball stadium. It was REALLLY cold while I was there so I would do a couple block circle around the area, and I put these 2 pieces together in honor of what I hope is the first of many talks and events celebrating and educating ourselves and others about this whole new world of blockchain technology.

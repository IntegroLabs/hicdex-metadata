Please Stand By, Learning How To Read. This piece was inspired by the comics that helped teach me how to read as a kid. Comics Played an integral part in my childhood and adult life and have in many ways shaped me into the man I am today. For many, comic books were the first pieces of reading material ever consumed. And while, up until recently, they were seen as low brow, un-sophisticated, trash reading by most, comics did not just inspire hordes of children to read, they helped to teach kids adult themes and concepts such as racism, spirituality and moral centers. I\u2019m ecstatic that in the last decade comics are finally getting their due, are less frowned upon than before, and are finally consumed by the masses, instead of the the fringes of society.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcdtCxmdLtpkb7os5JbkVM9LRmL81PYGXujN6cndnE9gA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZe1ZmS1m6C9tcLqM3p5EoTvgq6WKSDtJAqhqznpSCKef", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcdtCxmdLtpkb7os5JbkVM9LRmL81PYGXujN6cndnE9gA", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "color", "glitch", "glitchart", "tv", "colorpalette", "television", "colorpalettes"], "extra": {}}

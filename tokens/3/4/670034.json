Apollo is teaching Hyakinthos how to throw a discus. Horrifically angered by the sight, Zephyr blows a gust of wind in Apollo's direction, sending the discus hurtling back towards Hyakinthos. The discus strikes the young boy, killing him instantly.\nApollo, heartbroken, notices a flower has sprung up from the blood of Hyakinthos, and rightfully names the flower hyacinth, in the young boy's honor. There you have folks\u2014another Greek tragedy in the world of flowers.\n\nTherefore, hyacinths are often known as a symbol of jealousy and sorrow.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPC7EMJ7vitavqMHjBucBmxQ3ccZ8XnsLysytLL1b87cu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTsCZndH7spumQsnLJKYwr7SkHNkQ6Quc9gRqBYHe37B3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPC7EMJ7vitavqMHjBucBmxQ3ccZ8XnsLysytLL1b87cu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Ac42Zn368R9Xxbscsu1cfmS4wSSmrdjfk"], "tags": ["flower", "girlwithtatto", "sadly", "illustration", "folk", "hyacinth", "brush"], "extra": {}}

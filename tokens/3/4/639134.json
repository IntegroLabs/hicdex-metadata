{"__version": 1, "token_id": 639134, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Hate Comments", "description": "In recent years, technology has developed very rapidly. Human life is getting easier with the development of technology. One of them is internet technology which has now become a necessity for many people. Of the many inventions from internet technology, social media is the most popular by many people. Social media was originally designed to make it easier for humans to communicate and interact without having to meet in person.\n\nHowever, unfortunately, with the development of technology, it is not accompanied by the quality of education and knowledge of its users, namely humans themselves. Social media, which was originally a place to have fun, is no longer a safe place, let alone fun. Social media is used as a weapon to brutally attack others with the ferocity of words. Even those who display kindness are still looking for faults and then attacking them under the guise of an anonymous account. As for those who should fight for justice and care about mental health, they even attack other people who don't agree with themselves and their groups.\n\nIndeed, not all social users do this, but many seem to do so. Social media still has to be a fun place, there are many benefits that come from social media. Please stop hate comments.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUzXKuT2xM8jVk1gGaaNB9EzsPdtJJQVv4u5SG111ZVdc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRwnBiKwJv8Kepx7526AkHXbPfPtmZhFvdbG9ajo51ow9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUzXKuT2xM8jVk1gGaaNB9EzsPdtJJQVv4u5SG111ZVdc", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NZjpBs2HFJkSYszF2mDUEhFHobj9XfAim"], "tags": ["thewahyudan", "socialmedia", "technology", "illustration", "hated"], "extra": {}}

All kinds of beings I have meet are a silent witness, all things that passing by at my journey have been my travel knowledge.\nBut yours, indeed, far more superior. The solitude that covers your surroundings is a teacher of your everyday meditation. That, I need most; your perspective, your godly nexus...to face my unforeseen challenge yet. To uncover what I desire most about you.\n\nAnd now the world will be ours.\"\n\nValentine 2022 drop. \nInk and Pencil on Moleskine 185gr. Digital on Photoshop.

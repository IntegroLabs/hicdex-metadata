I once was in toxic relationship for 5 years, been gaslighted and pulled back in the name of love. I had never called out for help because I didn't think I was a victim, instead the person made me think I was an abuser. Now, even I can finally step out of the trap, I still cannot meet or talk to the person. I cannot hear the person's name. Please, do not let anyone hurt you in the name of love. It isn't love at all.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXEpNKipQuyWax6bEV1bhUWLYisciieAFiFAs3NiLYb7w", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaQiVNPBurEtSkf1W7We6zKqeX1JsmW3S1pDwo2GmRE7G", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXEpNKipQuyWax6bEV1bhUWLYisciieAFiFAs3NiLYb7w", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1in7Ruowm3YfHrjqLhJTHWWHEtXvLTXQ1X"], "tags": ["jehnsbloom", "painting", "fineart", "love", "hate", "toxic", "relationship"], "extra": {}}

A great winter will come, which will ruin the crops in the fields and kill the domestic animals. Many people will die of hunger, and those who survived will go mad with poverty and deprivation. The stars will fall to the ground, and the world tree itself will tremble from unprecedented earthquakes. Terrible monsters will break free, engulfing the Moon and the Sun, after which general darkness will come. Art by Yastich.

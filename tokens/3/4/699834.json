I went outside to get some fresh air amidst this never-ending pandemic. I took some pictures of sunsets and when I looked up, I saw a red dragon nesting right above the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. This is the legendary dragon, WYVERN (Waib\u0101n). It was just taking a rest right above the church and taking a relieving breath as it sees humanity from a different perspective. I guess it was just feeling lucky, that dragons don\u2019t have to feel or experience what we (as humans) are facing right now, either COVID or war. Surely. I do believe that someday we are able to conquer these problems. Stay healthy to all of you people out there, and love each other :)\n\n---------------------------\nKURO means black in Japanese and SHIRO means white.\n\nKUROSHIRO is a series of black and white pictures with a doodle of sightings all around Germany.

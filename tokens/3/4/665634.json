As a couple of birds fly through the orange sky, the wolf reflects on how many adversities he overcame to be in that beautiful and peaceful place that day. The scars on his snout, as well as the torn ears, are the marks of the battles he won until he got to where he is now.\n\nAbout the artist\n\nHi, my name is Daniela, but you can call me Dani. I am a dreamer female artist who lives in Brazil. My biggest dream is to live through my art and my creativity, and also to help make the world a fairer place for people and animals. If all goes well, I even intend to create shelters that are cozy and heavenly for abandoned or needy animals.\nI am currently in college, studying Visual Arts. I also love writing and playing the piano. I love animals a lot, including dinosaurs and the mythical ones like dragons.\nMy Twitter account: @danihp_art\nMy Instagram art account: @dani_hp_art", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmddNVZ1FaAQhhxTgdcwFeCgZK8nPRm1r6yiVUgv43CWZk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaENHuUqCpbzz2Pd3QsZ3umAubLCpk1evZsoz3bkcSNtF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmddNVZ1FaAQhhxTgdcwFeCgZK8nPRm1r6yiVUgv43CWZk", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MnL9oSz51vjrnFNt3oF3NQ6mfm6UoeSzQ"], "tags": ["wolf", "animal", "illustration", "art", "digitalart", "drawing", "emotional", "animals", "wolves", "arts", "artwork"], "extra": {}}

I'm going to sell NFTs which according to twitter.com are just links. Then I'll sell you a link to a link written by me making fun of how fundamentally absurd it is for anyone to pay for a link by creating that link I think. What will this link be? It is a link to something that was created earlier today, a slightly out-of-focus text representation of myself writing creatively at my desk creating something manic that is only to be understood by idiots! I have created something bigger than Ron Howard!\"\nMeanwhile at the white house\n\n\n\u201cLord Babababababa!!\u201d President Joe Biden screamed in a fit of rage. \u201cHe will pay, it doesn\u2019t matter how many lives I have to sacrifice to stop him.\u201d He slammed his desk and lit a joint while scratching his butt. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking no for an answer! Everyone will join in our fight against Lord Bababa and his scam!\"\n\n\u2014-\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied.

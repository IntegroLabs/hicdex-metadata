The artist was born with a unilateral breast agenesis, meaning her left breast never developed while the right breast developed into a full c-cup. Starting from age 16, she underwent several reconstructive surgeries to find symmetry.  17 years later, she recently underwent surgery to remove the breast implant, in her words \u201cchoosing freedom over societal standards of beauty.\u201d\n In this performative art film, the artist uses nature and her body to heal herself.  She  invites the viewer in to share the experience and journey of defining beauty through her own gaze.   \n\nThis unique digital art piece was created to accompany the digital premiere of \"Escape\" on February 15th, 2022.  \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVYj7ibD7taHfxskZU3vHZ3K9U9P3hBFAgVbZ6A2NAGs8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPjqQea1LgXFnZ5brDgiau7WqWuAc7X9kbdsF78nuQWVQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVYj7ibD7taHfxskZU3vHZ3K9U9P3hBFAgVbZ6A2NAGs8", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1dPFss8ngJy9Z3RkiNm5XgDzGqvCKcYe2Z"], "tags": ["premiere", "laladrona", "escape", "artvideo", "artperformance", "videoart", "performanceart", "medical", "implant", "fineart", "nature", "ecofeminism", "feminism", "body", "women"], "extra": {}}

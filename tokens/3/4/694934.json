Who from agricultural guardian ends in the God of war. Who would lead Rome to the top of the world through fighting.\nWe start the story with Juno, the goddess of marriage, who was forced to escape from Olympus. Seeking refuge, he came to the temple of Flora, the goddess of spring. Seeing her, the goddess told her to pick a flower.\nJuno was dazzled by a beautiful flower that was actually the god Jupiter in disguise. By placing her in her lap, the goddess of marriage conceived Mars, who would not be a simple peasant of great virility, strength and bad-tempered and combative character, but would become an imposing deity. Loved by all and feared by many more, he was asked for prosperity in the fields and victory in battle.\nMars managed to enter the dreams of Rhea, a princess who was forced to maintain a perpetual virginity so that her uncle would avoid being overthrown from power. From this meeting, R\u00f3mulo and Remo are born, who overthrew their great-uncle Amulio and regained power.\nA peasant, loved and respected by all, would become the strategist who would give Rome a new position in power, from his company in battle to the procreation of the founders of the same empire.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNZaSpR8ALjHG8CJ2AhuKFbr8Bxir6HebVaQSoDJTEGKJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbfHaaXMaxassAXg2a6JCKJZo95BtjBPTpFtjch5sKfEu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNZaSpR8ALjHG8CJ2AhuKFbr8Bxir6HebVaQSoDJTEGKJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2UQHerwwbr9WgvgE9jmqyPseMcuw2L7wSj"], "tags": ["mars", "statue", "sculpture", "god", "roman", "mitologt", "dark", "war"], "extra": {}}

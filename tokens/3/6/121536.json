The drawings were created with an Axidraw, but each one is different. The artist, Vanessa Rosa, moved the paper or the pen holder while the machine worked. It's as if Vanessa could recreate the pieces in collaboration with the machine. The purchaser of this NFT should receive the MP4 video and the 6 original 20x20cm(7,8x7,8 inches) drawings. Post fees should be charged separately.

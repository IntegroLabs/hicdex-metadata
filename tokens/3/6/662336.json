Merak is the Indonesian word for peacock. Created in 1950s by Raden Tjetje Somantri and Dra. Irawati, showing fascination with the beauty of peacocks.\n\nFor this, the dancers are dancing in a garden like peacocks, with a backdrop of kecombrang (torch ginger) flowers behind it and bamboo trees in the distance, accompanied by the Sundanese suling (flute).\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago of over 17000 islands. There are many tribes, with their own individual dances and costumes, spread along these islands. I want to share with you the dances of my family heritage and of places I live.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR8Xz98jm3fiS2P2CVYGut1TgF5fc1eavEkBXm1Bpvvgp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVm3Zusreh6Hagrj8FzHZ6khE6NtLtxzGbMys8LqbpyK8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmdXBbaaCbi6ag3oGntSkGoSCSJ7ga7pYT3kGo97yuurmH", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR8Xz98jm3fiS2P2CVYGut1TgF5fc1eavEkBXm1Bpvvgp", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2FQ9ciqi533mVrG8w1CvFP3xTKTE7jZGeV"], "tags": ["merak", "sunda", "dance", "dancer", "indonesia", "girls", "peacock", "traditional", "animation", "loop"], "extra": {}}

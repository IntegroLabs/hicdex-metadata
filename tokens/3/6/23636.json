I come from a family of 10 000 siblings! We are all unique in our own way but with a similar taste for life, we are \"lips\" after all. Our artist creator Daniel Eugene Botha gave us our DNA through art and generative programming so we can look presentable enough to be a part of your NFT collection. I know I have a lot of brothers and sisters to choose from, but please buy me, I will be the best HashLip you have ever owned! Chow for now, kiss you later.","tags":[],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmfCdN5MeFnH5ByaYWwXd58hNeGb1QoLFoC5pcekVKEoD2"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmfCdN5MeFnH5ByaYWwXd58hNeGb1QoLFoC5pcekVKEoD2","display_uri":"ipfs://QmYg8qYFBaHwDwGevuFrQt6tzaNy8yEZK17oG69NDgj85r","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

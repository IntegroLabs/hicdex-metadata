They used to live on a tiny planet in the Proxima solar system. One of the 7 Krotep stones was given to this lineage. In pursuit of these stones, the ruthless Veroun attacked the planet of the Trogs and committed a great genocide. The purpose of Veroun is to use the great energy and power released when these stones come together. Very few Trogs who were able to escape this massacre fled to planets in the binary solar system. Worgant was the guardian of Krotep stone, and managed to smuggle the this stone away from the ruthless Veroun. He is constantly traveling between planets in the binary solar system to lose track of himself. This stone he has will play a big role in the upcoming great war.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSDYpGcc5C81nuhSLAPrkiFhf9vXfd9N2KuZoEVh578od", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSDYpGcc5C81nuhSLAPrkiFhf9vXfd9N2KuZoEVh578od", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSDYpGcc5C81nuhSLAPrkiFhf9vXfd9N2KuZoEVh578od", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1XfjNtsmmxfaXo498yfQNnPVf8Q5JN8rFU"], "tags": ["hen", "gif", "sci-fi"], "extra": {}}

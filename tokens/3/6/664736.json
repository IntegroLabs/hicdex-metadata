Based on the artwork Malevich Sold Here (1989)\n\nSince the mid-\u201870s Alexander Kosolapov was one of the key figures of social art, painter, graphic artist, sculptor. Works are based on an ironically radical combination of recognizable symbols and stereotypes of Soviet ideology and global mass culture. By playing with images, the artist debunks both the political Soviet myth-making, as well as the capitalist fetishism of commodities. Works are in the MOMA New York, the Tretyakov Gallery, the Russian Museum, and other public and private collections", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXH9TaGK6hBUhB28NE3ffDQr1sGtAvVDK7nU1rm6yffAU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVUEUvuMxjNjJbhrVKpWLQSc74hffakhw1nAhNrj8Uuhk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmVMmQ3TMqVi4qPxozQidqR5zJae2hTaut4XZex9NADhxY", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXH9TaGK6hBUhB28NE3ffDQr1sGtAvVDK7nU1rm6yffAU", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fKwrRXF9eGHz7mjERGMsaY34rX753N5uF"], "tags": ["Kosolapov", "video", "malevich"], "extra": {}}

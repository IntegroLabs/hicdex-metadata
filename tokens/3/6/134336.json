She had a sturdy build and mischievous eyes and loved to laugh and gamble. A gentle married man, a few years older, was her friend. He was a very respected man in the village. We all had good times together. We drank warm beer and smoked with the other men in the village government. We all laughed. Foamy beer came out our noses. We laughed so much. You could see in the man's eyes that he loved LITTLE CLOUD. They became lovers. She gambled away the grocery money and more and got into trouble. The man gave her the money from the old peoples' home to pay her debts. When someone looked for the money and it was gone, the man confessed. The villagers then knew for sure that they were lovers. The man hung himself and LITTLE CLOUD was banished from the village.

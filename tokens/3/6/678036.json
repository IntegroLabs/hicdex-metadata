The generations taking over everybody is a follower, Trailing behind the bandwagon, Popping E, Sipping lean, Smoking weed, I guess that makes you fly like a butterfly, Sting like the bee from the tops of bottle caps of mickeys 40 0z malt liquor, One selection of the green bottle couture, Need more? I need less of that depressant, See I'm stressing, My uncle made it past 3 strokes and two heart attacks, All from days filled with alcohol and cigarettes, In his mid 40's I'm wondering how he's still alive seeing death five times, Doesn't god give you signs? Maybe god gives you time, To open up your eyes and realize drowning away your sorrows with a bottle just creates more problems in the long run, The effects of being on one, Now my little cousins on one, Should I tell him? Run, or let him find out on his own, Hard headedness runs inside my blood, 11 pints of O positive, Donations to any vampire who's down to swallow it.\n*CHORUS*\nDoesn't god give you signs?\nMaybe god give's you time.\nDoesn't god give you signs?\nMaybe god gives you time.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVZnfuwJv45XNTgFJp6seo3NrRrHoGtaD7Tdc46XnKNgx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSQRcBRLWBorpgiPXdafCddPc3RTEKgUHZShzZy3wUg47", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVZnfuwJv45XNTgFJp6seo3NrRrHoGtaD7Tdc46XnKNgx", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2MxjL7SLCvEVmUtASGpa3tjNwnKfJXYaBu"], "tags": ["hiphop", "underground", "music"], "extra": {}}

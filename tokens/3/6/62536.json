Getting the light to vibrate in such a way that it stirs something within an audience.  These images are my search for that moment of emotional resonance. The hardware has been abstracted by optics salvaged from a different type of display. A reminder that a lot of my hardware development has depended on hybridization. The goal is to capture the ephemeral nature of light and how light brings objects ","tags":["Photgraphy","Light","Optics"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmVkn1YqfTLtsFkgh83nXB9VWiHfrTeNCSpGLTMi5SSKAL"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVkn1YqfTLtsFkgh83nXB9VWiHfrTeNCSpGLTMi5SSKAL","display_uri":"ipfs://QmV727jQS1mFyDvZ67Q6AaZbMgmTLVaXK42RdJ4vd5jm2Z","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Case: 4383 - During an inspection of an abandoned victorian era mental hospital in Michigan that was scheduled for demolition, two of the investigators found a strange locked room barricaded behind shelving and upturned beds. Once unlocked the investigators discovered a man floating and spinning in the middle of the room. Even though there was no electricity provided to the building there was a single lightbulb suspended in the center of the room above the man that stayed illuminated. It is uncertain how long the man had been there but given that the hospital was abandoned in the early 1970's it is believed that he was forgotten about around that time. The two men contacted local authorities who upon investigation notified and handed the case to Federal Agents. The man was removed from the building in his catatonic coma state and was transferred to an unknown location outside of the state. The mans name is unknown and to there is no record beyond this information.

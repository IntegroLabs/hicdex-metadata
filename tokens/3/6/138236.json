Whether it is a keyboard, a pen, pencil or paintbrush, your opinion must be shared. Artists have the opportunity to share insight and express the experiences of those who've been displaced from their homes. We are stronger together. If you're an artist who creates work raising awareness about those displaced, please reach out and connect with me on Twitter or Instagram.","tags":["UNHCR","REFUGEES","ASYLUM","UNITY"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmXYjE3faneBzSrrJ6TbLv5y33iWvnByhjhwXeuVsjs789","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXYjE3faneBzSrrJ6TbLv5y33iWvnByhjhwXeuVsjs789","display_uri":"ipfs://QmWRUx6TZBe6qyWVwu1Y9thkwttNVaUBfuchQMhQnFtjoJ","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

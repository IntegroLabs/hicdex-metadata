The dogs ran around, barking & chasing the bunny relentlessly, until the bunny ran out of batteries, collapsed & died. The second the bunny was lifeless, the dogs stopped caring. This photo often describes how I feel because I run myself ragged until I burn out, become exhausted, and physically & emotionally canâ€™t do any more.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTxK1jZ67LXh61KvHX6AfnhjmkyvCTMSacF47c2b3jMfr","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1Uoi5RKjM7fREEHrUnY8aAy3VQ8xn9ZWqw"],"tags":["photo","photography","death","dead","burnout","animal","bunny","taxidermy","millennial","peaceful","calm","nature","2012","sunnycrittenden"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmTxK1jZ67LXh61KvHX6AfnhjmkyvCTMSacF47c2b3jMfr"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmYktmf9xuU97oEMxuZ5BeYhYmXzdhdE16PkKLYZNTrvzC"},"supply":"13","transfered":36}

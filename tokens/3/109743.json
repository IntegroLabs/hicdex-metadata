Hippocrates is taken as the founder of medicine, skull is taken as a symbol of death. They join in one image because of the requirement to wear masks and gloves for all the people during COVID pandemic, but masks can really help to reduce virus spreading, while gloves don't help and make danger. Virus doesn't come out from the body of an ill person thru skin and doesn't get in thru skin, so, gloves don't have meaning for hands. Same time people who wear gloves feel more protected and do less care. No difference if to touch face with gloves or without gloves. Infection may come in thru eyes, from any touching surface. Gloves don't make change. Same time long wearing of not \"breathing\" gloves would damage skin. A meeting of World Health Organization committee is in the bottom of the collage. Questions on the top are about the reasons.

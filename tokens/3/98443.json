One of the unknown objects is an orb that gives off energy generated from tides such as electrical energy. Tidal energy is a type of renewable energy whose numbers are relatively more predictable compared to wind energy and solar energy. Its utilization has not been widespread because from high initial costs and a limited location with sufficient tide. Further research and development is being carried out to improve efficiency and the critical limit of the energy it produces are varied a method obtained for extracting this type of energy.  important notes! The orbs are guarded by several unidentified creatures", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXoyjEfYpH1syMDUhbYuUKKmjQT7pgjN4ZwUpwCzQT1Tv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXzjMy57YGe1z6GU41ziQ7EEwhcWFPhThJnR2TPYFHaae", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1dpR1BXUnzizjTyG2pW4kMPEGmCWGwM8gH"], "tags": ["MrKinur", "Art", "2D", "3D", "Art", "Illustration", "Animation", "Space", "UnknownObject", "Limited", ""], "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmXoyjEfYpH1syMDUhbYuUKKmjQT7pgjN4ZwUpwCzQT1Tv"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmT18RYL3sap8PVLWUBTq8A82DJekcBKxA9YnP8NmKB8YK"}, "supply": "10", "transfered": 10}

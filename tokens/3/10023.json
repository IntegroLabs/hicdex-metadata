The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying says:  The Dzogchen Tantras, the ancient teachings from which the bardo instructions come, speak of a mythical bird, the garuda, which is born fully grown. This image symbolizes our primordial nature, which is already completely perfect. The garuda chick has all its wing feathers fully developed inside the egg, but it cannot fly before it hatches. Only at the moment when the shell cracks open can it burst out and soar into the sky.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTPwewBp2fWGn2QKC9bZtQZRL3QB7waJSH8cztz8mcGtf","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmTPwewBp2fWGn2QKC9bZtQZRL3QB7waJSH8cztz8mcGtf"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmULQTcSq4dahaHB1kExT3gHfMWA3WKJq8T4hZ8nEEocWx"},"supply":"1","transfered":1}

There was a really old Italian lady that was there early in the morning arranging things. Her sons ran it and you could get deals like a dozen eggs for a dollar and fresh fruit. It really is sad to see family run things like this just vanish from places like New York, Boston and everywhere else.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWbuViAZMCFpHL65TZEWPUzako91HsQEE3JhCAc8BUXm2","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmWbuViAZMCFpHL65TZEWPUzako91HsQEE3JhCAc8BUXm2"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://Qmd5YLRX4wSh2SG2JmgWofgXJU93p4VKV6KvpdGRoerXGS"},"supply":"500","transfered":251}

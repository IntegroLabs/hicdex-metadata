The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYM7gNr6r2BTn2hiMMJahz5ZJCWYhzpsG3S5f9RPqPZLp","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1ft8ZPvFdcsMa2LyyA4h53Mm61bRHXBMfc"],"tags":["generative","random","gif","cca"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmYM7gNr6r2BTn2hiMMJahz5ZJCWYhzpsG3S5f9RPqPZLp"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmVkqwxukfKNWwLCdyZGSR1kKNeSx7Cnb9KNZX2V3ohRuH"},"supply":"1","transfered":1}

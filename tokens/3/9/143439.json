In all these movements, they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the time. Finally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries. The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Proletarians of all countries, unite!\" \u2015 Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbG6JXWWpH852ns9S3AegDwDy7LFdBJ4QyN1McDL1NyYw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbG6JXWWpH852ns9S3AegDwDy7LFdBJ4QyN1McDL1NyYw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbG6JXWWpH852ns9S3AegDwDy7LFdBJ4QyN1McDL1NyYw", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YuyeYd9VhZ5QWR1Q9X8ikiRcmMCvmKJWw"], "tags": ["communistmanifesto", "abstract", "animation", "marx"], "extra": {}}

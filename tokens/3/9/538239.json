The rules of the Order prescribe a life of poverty and humility, reflected in the sitter\u2019s coarse cloak and air of quiet introspection. In 1660, Titus and Hendrikje, Rembrandt\u2019s mistress, established an art business, with Rembrandt as their only employee. This enabled Rembrandt to avoid creditors and continue painting many of his best works until his death in 1669.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXQK4FCR1fmJd6JpFgSyhmhXMcD2M8DjWZDKzoLEa3hKK", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8AT8uyhchjz7rkUAPUxBbHkYio4xYjADzsoXaVPvcVz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXQK4FCR1fmJd6JpFgSyhmhXMcD2M8DjWZDKzoLEa3hKK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2K9wBA1SCU1u7rEepyQngHhFnRo7MH2Rbi"], "tags": ["oilpainting", "abstractpainting", "abstractfigurative", "inkpainting", "experimental", "realis", "surrealism", "mixedmedia", "digitalpainting", "anattafeel", "repaint", "RembrandtvanRijn"], "extra": {}}

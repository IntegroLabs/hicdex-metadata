I would know, because this is a dance I danced & performed as a child. \n\nThis dance tells the story of the dancing deer; kijang means deer in Indonesian). As kids, we would perform on stages, with traditional carvings of doors or painted scenery. In this scenery there is the twin moutains Sindoro & Sumbing, of Central Java. It is also a something often drawn by Indonesian children to depict nature in schools.\n\nThe music is performed by the orkes (band) of my neighborhood using angklung (an instrument made of bamboo) and tambourines.\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago of over 17000 islands. There are many tribes, with their own individual dances and costumes, spread along these islands. I want to share with you the dances of my family heritage and of places I live.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ7kPRW52PMh173gUWCAZP29hkSpawDei8cKjrjupsQPp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQZdBsd6LkagBBszXmRc75VkwAjdxFjqx77FwdBjgMS11", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://Qmf3ayXqkFUet6Hz6HbxBGVD9pmUm2HfjCfXWFz9fX8Wa8", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ7kPRW52PMh173gUWCAZP29hkSpawDei8cKjrjupsQPp", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2FQ9ciqi533mVrG8w1CvFP3xTKTE7jZGeV"], "tags": ["kijang", "indonesia", "bali", "jawa", "java", "deer", "dance", "dancer", "kids", "performance", "animation", "loop"], "extra": {}}

This word ladder represents the furthest I've taken this concept. We can look towards the human system of money and observe how it has built and destroyed societies throughout the ages. We discover underlying human traits that are inherent in all of us: elements of greed, envy, jealousy, etc. Money and power have the tendency to polarize the masses into the have's and the have-nots. It's a story that repeats on every corner of the world at every moment in time. Why do we work for money? Why not work for progress? Why not work to help other people? Why not work to be enlightened? Why does everything have to have a price tag? I get the philosophy and purpose of money, but haven't we evolved as societies to move on from this archaic undercurrent of reality? It's possible I'm psychologically jaded from once having money to now owning very little. Or maybe from experiencing the emptiness of the bang of wealth to savoring the fullness of those moments of bust, I've been learning to adapt and appreciate the contributions of those less fortunate than myself; wisdom lies everywhere. Open your heart and let compassion in; know the feeling of equanimity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQhn7GVWPhQhvRA2XTcjbfrKPw5Rjo212EcUjAewhKs8j", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXx4JjhpL9ewuYXFZMPnQUT2qaJMwLCGR2afczBREsRn1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQhn7GVWPhQhvRA2XTcjbfrKPw5Rjo212EcUjAewhKs8j", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

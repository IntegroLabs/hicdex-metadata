Before he started working on the movie, he had lived a normal life with his wife and two hundred children and sold mushroom crackers in FREAKOLAND! and around the world.  Now he is in a catatonic state of staring at the magic stone, and when anyone comes near, he looks like a demon, trying to protect it. We hope that some warriors help him get the stone to where it belongs.

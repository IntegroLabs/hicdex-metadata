When psilocybin is ingested, it is broken down by the liver in a process called dephosphorylation. The resulting compound is called psilocin, which is responsible for the psychedelic effects.\n\nThis is all to say that mushrooms are fantastic!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaPMsLmqo28Fh5pNKAX4dYorSVp73qakEY7F7WbgRAuCt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbBf3829Y7k5t7vau8D4zcu9AgrZxhZ28mnMK5BNrGPWN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaPMsLmqo28Fh5pNKAX4dYorSVp73qakEY7F7WbgRAuCt", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ggYfGtuZ6TjiRPWV5Va4fQE7pj3uTtQ9d"], "tags": ["animation", "C4D", "psychedelicart", ""], "extra": {}}

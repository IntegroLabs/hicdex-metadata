For buyers, since H=N only allows 40MB, I can send the original files. Contact me: gustavohpaim@gmail.com. This is the fifth of my Droning Loop series, a repetition exercise with drum machine pads being fed through the return channel of the mixer into my homemade dub echo unit: a reverb tank taken from my guitar amp and the tape deck acting as a tape delay.

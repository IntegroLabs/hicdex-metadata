Dervish is an average sized fluffle with all common traits, and a rare variant of devil horns!!   Dervish much prefers the outdoors to being inside. Woods, mountains, deserts or jungles it doesnt matter. The traveling/backpacking lifestyle is their tea and you will never convince them that staying inside for extended periods is better.    Dervish does have a tendency to wander off on their own and has a terrible sense of direction. Though  Dervish does seem to excel at foraging and hunting on their own, too long on their own in the wild may result in a fluffle thats still comfertable with people and no longer adverse to hunting them.

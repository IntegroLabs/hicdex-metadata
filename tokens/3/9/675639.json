'Glass Stars' was taken in Busan, South Korea. I named this piece because of the twinkling lights placed on buildings all around. It is a very common sight, they have replaced natural stars.\n\nI spent my nights wandering the city looking for sights that would catch my eye. Korea has a cyberpunk-like vibe to its cities, it is not uncommon to see neon and LED signs and a plethora of lights. Despite the abundance of light, it is difficult to capture an image that I am happy to share. \n\tThere is an additional element that I like in my images, which is the atmosphere. That is provided by the weather, in the majority of cases, rain. Rain allows for beautiful reflections and alongside all the lights, makes Busan appear very cyberpunk.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdWRn3C9hDHdTbRETyGGQaYp5VVYFTX89nJQQ5yCbd6Gg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZLT8yoMbRQzF6B33xo73fC1V7eptU9QQNNbgvanvV9QY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdWRn3C9hDHdTbRETyGGQaYp5VVYFTX89nJQQ5yCbd6Gg", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iimuCRajJPgHsMAtxUToEUiggn3uyMj4Y"], "tags": ["Cyberpunk", "Scifi", "Neonnoir", "Rain", "Asia", "Busan", "SouthKorea"], "extra": {}}

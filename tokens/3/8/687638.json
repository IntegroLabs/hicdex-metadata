Will we be making a better and wiser usage of technology? One thing is for sure. Once we get there, we will embrace the shift from a centralized understanding of the world, to a decentralized one. A whole new perspective that will respect the ecology of everything, both natural and artificial.\n\nThe subject, fully rotating at 360 degrees embodies this upcoming view upon the world, taking shape as an exemplary individual within Society 3.0. Here, as a matter of fact, every single individual will become a \u201cnation\u201d, granted equity in the access and management of personal information, with a layer of reciprocal protection.\n\n#NEBUXEL006", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP3EtPpVRskjzqi5m9VJ6cqTSMY9Xftk3cEXjZNvkZZBn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT3B1EDS21NmUNaMthBzbS5Ky78aKYbdBuBqD1pWnd8z3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP3EtPpVRskjzqi5m9VJ6cqTSMY9Xftk3cEXjZNvkZZBn", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz2F56onbyxZ2MypDhZ8dmksUjiz8nFGuH28"], "tags": ["nebuxel006", "006", "nebuxel", "decentralized", "gammatrace"], "extra": {}}

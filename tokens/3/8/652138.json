There aren\u2019t exact information about the source of inspiration for the painting but it is generally interpreted as the tired state of a dervish, patiently aiming to enhance an underdeveloped society. In my work, I skew the circumstance with black humor and criticize the retrograding society. I argue that a change won\u2019t be possible unless socities\u2019 barbarian taboos are destroyed and the individual secures its personal awareness, leaving their primitive urges aside.\n\n3217x4274 px\n300 dpi\nDigital Illustration", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTsp4oXJHyD4VuhTYPuVtgQqKPEceKuoS3Y6Wr7x7kttJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRUxg919Fmh9A3G2yei2Si39pKhYi6QHyDR7jb9NXGQe4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTsp4oXJHyD4VuhTYPuVtgQqKPEceKuoS3Y6Wr7x7kttJ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TQLTrasjakNNfkKQMZs6BAuw1h3mefkC2"], "tags": ["illustration", "digitalart", "satire"], "extra": {}}

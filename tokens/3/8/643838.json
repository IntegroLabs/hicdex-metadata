She became \"famous\" among my friends on social media because she always had the most witty comments (which I shared using my \"little black box\", as she referred to it). \n\nShe was definitely a character. \n\n\"Grandma & The Filters\" is a series of 10 videos (each in editions of 10) all taken on the first day she experienced what phone \"filters\" are. \n\nEileen died last January at the age of 95. I thought this would be a nice way to go back and celebrate her.\n\n15% of any profits made from these will go to Dorothy Ley Hospice in Toronto where my Grandpa John volunteered for many years.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdi1wdGR6cq9wCXT16UdacEBSJqJnbLHD2BTJauHK1p34", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSaiud77WnaY2u6L81ATGeDDD5p6HucszSQtNrZuzy6xK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdi1wdGR6cq9wCXT16UdacEBSJqJnbLHD2BTJauHK1p34", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MSjGZofpZA2SpXSzJLZCzSTYGbjzdsqsE"], "tags": ["#mp4", "#video", "#funny", "#grandma", "#filters", "#humor", "#humour", "#comedy", "#wisdom", "#technology", "#phones"], "extra": {}}

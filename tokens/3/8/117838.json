Fabio FON, 2020.","description":"“Poema progresso” is a visual poem created in 2020 by Fabio FON from the shapes of the Brazilian flag. The yellow diamond of the flag was cut in half and its right half was inverted, overlapping the \"progress\" - one of the two nouns present on the flag, together with \"order\". There is no more \"progress\".

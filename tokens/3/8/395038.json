The quiet, peaceful, bustle of the little vacation town has an incredible vibe. It was always one of the most peaceful walks to get from our ship docked into town. Along the way was Fishermans Wharf not only amazing fish and chips to make sure you had a full belly for the rest of the evening but what a beautiful place to sit and have date night.. And who said fish and chips cant be romantic.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVwJEEKxLfJa44VowvKjvqavHdLBjGKc9U34kQfSpBBxq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPaExdwVaG3dnA9dziPtCx8mVbzBJtJWHxzE1C1LarJgS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVwJEEKxLfJa44VowvKjvqavHdLBjGKc9U34kQfSpBBxq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dT1cPF73Cc51o9pu9CCMiyz9AbmT71Fgs"], "tags": ["longexposure", "sunset", "fishandchips", "wharf", "Victoria", "Vancouverisland"], "extra": {}}

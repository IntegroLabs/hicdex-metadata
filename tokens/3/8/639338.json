But as the days goes by, I'm getting further and further away from all my hobbies. Even though it's my hobbies that have helped a lot so far, I don't even know now where are all my comics and manga. In fact, I am an One Piece topnotch manga reader.\n\nWith this artwork I wanna celebrate that loses and get back to my old hobby again. I remember the point to make myself happy instead of all.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVk5sUK43CHLyR4nVE1fpLyLxNoNfWAbFmd8sSzExjnAN", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme3uVK44oQmywJL14tiGsDGT88jHLZXqwpqaeUuyV2H8t", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVk5sUK43CHLyR4nVE1fpLyLxNoNfWAbFmd8sSzExjnAN", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Wd5APcDZ4JwNn28NKCo37qmgyyUnwuVwx"], "tags": ["onepiece", "goldroger", "d", "roger", "illustration", "characterdesign", "wanted", "manga", "poster", "paulmckaryo", "2dcartoon"], "extra": {}}

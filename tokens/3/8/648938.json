According to Dahmer, on this particular occasion, he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before closing time that evening, Sears \"just started talking to me\". Dahmer lured Sears to his grandmother's home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before Dahmer drugged and strangled Sears.\n\nThe following morning, Dahmer placed the corpse in his grandmother's bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting to flay the corpse. He then stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which he again disposed of in the trash. According to Dahmer, he found Sears \"exceptionally attractive\", and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears' head and genitalia in acetone and stored them in a wooden box, which he later placed in his work locker. When he moved to a new address the following year, he took the remains there.\n\n.png 700x700", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZRJGhm8yiTUn3bZqqDjS9xxZyR48x1aKipK62BAvutAg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZRJGhm8yiTUn3bZqqDjS9xxZyR48x1aKipK62BAvutAg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZRJGhm8yiTUn3bZqqDjS9xxZyR48x1aKipK62BAvutAg", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1azj8FrRpepP1ydXJEMcLcnf6JyybrcPah"], "tags": ["watercolor", "ai", "digital", "murder", "death", "jeffreydahmer", "cannibalism", "evil", "scary", "bloody"], "extra": {}}

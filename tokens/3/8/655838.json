These words changed and shaped my thought through a massive brainstorming and dip me into the silence. I called them unspoken words.\nAfter a while, I tried to speak about them but through another form, the form that speaks about me and of course instead of me. this procedure made me an expert and shaped the skill of turning the standard form of the words into the unspoken form of the words.\nLike a photographer who speaks without any word through his photos or a painter who presents his thoughts by his specific painting.\nThis collection was created by my mind, by my thought, and by my unspoken words.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfAJ7yZs2G4tv3N6tnNyAiBvXFZEkADyeXJe1pim1j9o8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPCUwcUQGGi2d2rbiEvb8RXRzMkxxXovmDNqnHFNMHur6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfAJ7yZs2G4tv3N6tnNyAiBvXFZEkADyeXJe1pim1j9o8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hGgLGoNcFEhRsHNvaU16GHY5DkxepPvTs"], "tags": ["NFT", "Color", "Calligraphy", "black&white", "NFTcollector", "modern", "abstract", "painting", "NFTs", "character", "art", "artist"], "extra": {}}

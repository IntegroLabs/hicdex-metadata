Her people had to suffer many years during a huge infestation of the lichworms. Shaped by this experience her plan for Trealla is to resign from the intergalactic association and ban all outgoing and incoming spaceflights to avoid a new spread of the lichworms which often come unrecognized in deliveries from other planets.

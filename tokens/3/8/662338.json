This time the Barong is chasing the leak through the rice terraces of Tegallalang, Ubud. The music is performed by Balinese gamelan performers.\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago of over 17000 islands. There are many tribes, with their own individual dances and costumes, spread along these islands. I want to share with you the dances of my family heritage and of places I live.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU4MEojejcBaesePRNTkmKeJfLfjPtQZVbrcYrnKubZBR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYW9HeXTTyEAava4st7jk8PHZRF2uMgJrME8y38XGQZvK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://Qmc3nqWvCiw3oAdxG5z92zmebVpkY2kjbXH6aCddXzXp9k", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU4MEojejcBaesePRNTkmKeJfLfjPtQZVbrcYrnKubZBR", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2FQ9ciqi533mVrG8w1CvFP3xTKTE7jZGeV"], "tags": ["bali", "barong", "pendet", "indonesia", "dancer", "leak", "ubud", "penjor", "janur", "dance", "rice"], "extra": {}}

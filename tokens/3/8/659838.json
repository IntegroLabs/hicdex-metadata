At the height of the COVID pandemic all stores in the downtown core boarded and shuttered in place. As a creative art initiative, artists took over the streets and used these pieces of plywood to bring art back into the street. These pieces do not exist anymore, they have been cut and used for many other purposes. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNysR1KgKWqw4nExi77fcWL2VLv7nD7R59YCji8ZgWMyy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZRUPzkCYaXZrHiC28hHizw1Ww2y76pAMoRq81a1p4Xtn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNysR1KgKWqw4nExi77fcWL2VLv7nD7R59YCji8ZgWMyy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Pajdkp6peGQsLShYcA5EhfJ6ND858hn5U"], "tags": ["art", "painting", "mural", "abstract", "spraypaint", "flora", "photo", "still"], "extra": {}}

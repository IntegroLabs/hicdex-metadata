When thoughts come to mind, disregard them, thinking \"hmmm\" or \"oh well\" and turn your attention back to your body.\n\nLet your muscles become loose and relaxed, starting with your feet... your ankles... lower legs... knees... upper legs... pelvis... torso... back... shoulders... arms... hands... face... and head.\n\nFeel your body... loose and relaxed...\n\nTurn your attention now to your breathing. Notice each breath, without trying to change your breathing in any way... Just observe... As thoughts arise, acknowledge them and let them go, returning your attention to your breathing...\n\nBreathe naturally... Slowly...\n\nAs your thoughts wander, simply return your attention to your breathing.\n\nNotice your breath as it flows gently in and out of your body... Without any effort...\n\nAcknowledge your thoughts and focus again on your breathing... Interruptions are normal... just let these thoughts go and return your attention to your breathing...\n\nNow think of the meaningful word or phrase you selected... and say this word or phrase in your mind as you exhale...\n\nEach time you breathe out, say the word or the phrase...\n\nAs your thoughts wander, bring your attention again to repeating your meaningful statement with each out breath.\n\nContinue repeating the word or phrase each time you exhale...\n\nBring your attention back to the word or phrase you are repeating with each gentle breath out...\n\nWith passive acceptance, continue to focus on the word or phrase, repeating it each time you breathe out... allowing distracting thoughts to float by...\n\nNow slowly begin to reawaken... and turn your attention to your breathing. Notice your calm, smooth breaths...  and out... Allow your awareness to turn now to your body... calm and relaxed... Notice how your body feels... become more aware of your surroundings...\n\nLet your attention turn now to your thoughts... back to normal conscious awareness... Normal attention to thoughts...\n\nSit quietly for a moment with your eyes open... enjoying the feeling of relaxation while gradually re-awakening... adjust your position slightly...\n\nReflect upon the experience of meditation... notice what it was like... notice how you feel now... Free from worries about how well you did... knowing that whatever happened was the correct and natural response.\n\nWiggle your fingers and toes... roll your shoulders... stretch if you like... And when you are ready, continue on with the rest of your day.\n\n\u00b0\u00ba\u00a4\u00f8,\u00b8\u00b8,\u00f8\u00a4\u00ba\u00b0`\u00b0\u00ba\u00a4\u00f8,\u00b8,\u00f8\u00a4\u00b0\u00ba\u00a4\u00f8,\u00b8\u00b8,\u00f8\u00a4\u00ba\u00b0`\u00b0\u00ba\u00a4\u00f8,\u00b8\n\n1200x1200 px - Animated GIF - Infinite loop - \u00a92021 - @V3RM1N3_", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmafJaVXTpD6CZiWVDJybZxiLYyHd9VJMyuHqmc5w6xvDp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmafJaVXTpD6CZiWVDJybZxiLYyHd9VJMyuHqmc5w6xvDp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmafJaVXTpD6CZiWVDJybZxiLYyHd9VJMyuHqmc5w6xvDp", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WgYpFP6A18hHJFsjd8PuW9XrAqeQC1jrx"], "tags": ["gif", "techno", "pixel", "generative", "punk", "generativeart", "animated", "pixelart", "code", "animatedgif", "electro", "glitch", "vermine", "javascript", "cosmic", "cypherpunk", "video", "art"], "extra": {}}

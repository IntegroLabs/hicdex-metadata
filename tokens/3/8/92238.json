She is a woman who has fantasies, everything around her is beautiful. The gold around her represents wealth. Her beauty is sad. Lonely life Without love Her beauty makes her not find true love. The meaning of the word love has changed. Her search for true love was darkened. I am writing pictures from digital works. I imagine a lonely love I hope that someday the woman in this picture will find true and perfect love.","tags":["golden","dream","woman","paint","painting","drew","imagination","arts",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmRxgvk3dAPbgGtpJAL4dM3qCFiXF2NEbqBXcXYkabe2tZ"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRxgvk3dAPbgGtpJAL4dM3qCFiXF2NEbqBXcXYkabe2tZ","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

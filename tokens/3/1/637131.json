Exploring the gates and fortifications along the ramparts is quite the adventure, all the while catching glimpses of the historic city spread out below, inviting you to discover all of the shops, restaurants, and hidden gems within its walls.\n\nSpanning almost 3 miles, these stone ramparts served to defend Qu\u00e9bec City's Upper Town since the 17th century. The Citadelle of Qu\u00e9bec forms part of these fortifications, and is still a functioning military installation.\n\n#2 in the \"Inviting You Through\" series, a collection of windows and covered passages, which will invite you to look or travel through them, to see what's on the other side, or simply enjoy the journey of getting there.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZDYdgz9ZSP9dCH6fMFa33GSeaEyVy8ph1vTRBQ7Honva", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWiT8oBVx5af99n3BmWrnCpRjJWWj1sxYa2ChgkQwyvxE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZDYdgz9ZSP9dCH6fMFa33GSeaEyVy8ph1vTRBQ7Honva", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz29ZRzr7Le6QHCpj3WwH67bEBZhfb1edpEo"], "tags": ["digital", "photography", "window", "wall", "rampart", "quebec", "city", "street", "canada"], "extra": {}}

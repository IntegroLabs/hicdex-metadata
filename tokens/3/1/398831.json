In Indian history, women find little or no significant place, but things are different when we turn to the history of the Mewar Kingdom of Udaipur. Saheliyon Ki Bari is one of the rare areas in the history of India, where a particular place is built for women.\n\nThe Garden of Maidens found in the Udaipur district of Rajasthan is a marvelous wonder of nature and its beauty designed with utmost care and perfection. The garden offers mesmerizing views of handsomely carved marble pavilions, kiosks in the pool, a lotus pond, and rain fountains.\n\nSaheliyon Ki Bari is yet another token of undying love. Rana Sangram Singh, also known as Rana Sanga of the Mewar dynasty, got the garden built to please his ladylove. The garden creates a unique sense of pleasure and extraordinarily calms your soul. This exquisite feeling is beyond words. The garden was also made for the 48 maids who came to Udaipur with the Queen as a wedding gift.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZYnpv1m9aEXbbLAJL53ZNKbMn7kvts35fE4rnCABnq5z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaegH6WEgnPqngb47u9b14W6nwhMBJkfm8i7xtZ9PVx1d", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZYnpv1m9aEXbbLAJL53ZNKbMn7kvts35fE4rnCABnq5z", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtsD76dp6B5agbmBDP79VXnLFkgPJ3Tpk"], "tags": ["art", "collectables", "color", "png", "history", "streetart", "jpg", "streetphotography", "photo", "abstract", "photography", "citypalace", "royal", "palace", "minimal", "digitalart", "jpg", "photo", "streetphoto", "abstract", "minimalart", "streetphotography", "streetart", "india", "minimalphotography", "dark", "fineartphotography", "portrait", "art", "fineart"], "extra": {}}

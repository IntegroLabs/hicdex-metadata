A week before my new insurance started, I was in the hospital for 4 days because of diabetic ketoacidosis. This left me $30,000 in medical debt. I'm selling my bill as an NFT because hospital billing is an art form, and they've spent years honing their craft. I'm already a slave to the healthcare industry because I require insulin, please don't let them tighten the noose even more.

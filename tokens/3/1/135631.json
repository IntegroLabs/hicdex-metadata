Then I was very fond of Soviet mosaics and murals, this prompted me to different experiments. I even created a mosaic in the style of that time. Many sketches were in this style, but then I mixed it with pixel art, which I soon became interested in too. Such is the result of a cool mix of techniques. This is the ideal city as I imagined it, where all Soviet art remained untouched.","tags":["PixelArt","city","night","SovietArt","RetroFuturism","sky","smoke","stars",""],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmYaqVV7hXqk6fuUMKYCssn1GoptMucyziK5pzbnJ9nyo6","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYaqVV7hXqk6fuUMKYCssn1GoptMucyziK5pzbnJ9nyo6","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZTJU6KnhjmWy9emtKLEEiArFC154NCrL77bxhj7hznro","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

This piece has been released to anyone who has collected two or more of my early Hic et Nunc pieces. Thank you for your support!\n\nXisal_617425_r05_d02_a00_b01\nThe initial seed for this loop of 480 frames is 617425, which selects function 0 with offset (-35.0, 5.0), range (4.0, 3.0), and function 1 with offset (-93.0, -67.0), range (-3.0, 4.1). Noise is produced from sampling points on an ellipse at co-ordinates (81.0, 28.0) with diameters (6.0, 1.0). The three formulae are combined using algorithm 5 with hue values starting at 194 with range 44. The grid is 201 units square.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbRFYwbWBVoqAX33LcPz7bHMFKK8GnFx13MXHiTYYqLme", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbRFYwbWBVoqAX33LcPz7bHMFKK8GnFx13MXHiTYYqLme", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbRFYwbWBVoqAX33LcPz7bHMFKK8GnFx13MXHiTYYqLme", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VjCS2jiBTVPSEoYzJ79KkbYV5QbFJxuf3"], "tags": ["thankyou", "mandybrigwell", "noise", "loop", "processing", "grid", "617425"], "extra": {}}

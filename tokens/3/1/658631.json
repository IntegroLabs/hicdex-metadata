I notice that I often tend to use red and green in my paintings. My 'The Apple' series mainly deals with the fall of innocence, I feel like the green in this painting places it in a technological light.\n\nOriginal piece by Lisha Ruan. Created in 2022.\n\nI am a 26-year-old artist living in Maryland, USA. Besides art, I like to write poetry and play the piano. My art seeks to capture the simultaneously symbiotic and tense relationship between order and chaos. Creation and destruction, are simultaneously flip sides of a coin and the same thing. In art, as in life, I seek encounters with what we most love and what we most fear.\n\nThanks for joining me. Your attention is precious and I hope my art to be deserving of it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ1iLZmGuoc6xrg5y5EpXWNdSqcP5PVrbphYo2GTYRSuV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQWMgoMSnysVgktBfobnW5utzbuTPBppKxNJhLjTZXgVq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ1iLZmGuoc6xrg5y5EpXWNdSqcP5PVrbphYo2GTYRSuV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NtLeXgpZQbWsMTMsECahg6oR88tU7iCTq"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "abstract", "apple", "glitch"], "extra": {}}

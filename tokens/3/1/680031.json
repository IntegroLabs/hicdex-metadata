Then we usually make our own safety. Maybe like an achor, a roof, a safety net, a wall, anything. All of those things i said it was just metaphor for the actual achor. That is principle. Hanging to what we believe, so wherever we go we still remember the fundamental of our life. Minimize the chance to get lost far away from ourself but still able to move around searching for what to be found.\n\n\n|About Journey to The Unexplored|\n\nExplore can be anything. It can be places, feelings, someone, thoughts, literally anything. This is a collection of my photographs that i captured during the darkest time and post-darkest time of my life. Exploring places is just metaphor for guide us to a deeper meaning.\n\nShots on 35mm using Fujica M1 analog camera taken in Indonesia.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRU4KAKDeD7osgNyutFkM1dTj7bFMi5byeDDSKpeRBWLw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUGMwanmTmJqZUMai2sZn78MWs5YfaLxihSn3CuMxGoGk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRU4KAKDeD7osgNyutFkM1dTj7bFMi5byeDDSKpeRBWLw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hTndxxhNiEgMjXGi3WbvR6iz2NpCFRtcJ"], "tags": ["Photography", "analog", "film", "travel"], "extra": {}}

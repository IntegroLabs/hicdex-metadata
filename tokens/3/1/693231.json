{"__version": 1, "token_id": 693231, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "JUST AS I MAGENTA IT.", "description": "\"JUST AS I MAGENTA IT.\" is a color pun that plays on our concepts of memory and perception. Do we remember things as they were or how we thought they were? Where do our faded memories go? Are lost memories truly lost or can they be located and retrieved? Can memories be manipulated? When we look at this work, we can think of the original implied sentence, which was, 'Just as I imagined it.', and see how our memory has been hijacked with the pun. Our memory has been deceived, this is not how we imagined it; it's how we magenta'd it. Further more, what makes this even more more peculiar is that the color of magenta/fuchsia doesn't actually exist. As stated on a previous page, our eyes only have types of rods and cones that differ in their sensitivity to photons of different wavelengths. The color of magenta/fuchsia is a color made up inside our minds to compensate for not have a 4th rod/cone type in our eyes. So our mind is playing a trick on us when we see magenta/fuchsia and gives an inception like memory of something that not only isn't there, but never was.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcWw1RYFosazVA4gGSAfxv9suM94JzuevxC9qEPEXV963", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmay5BZvXmoH1AkHtQMfYrTy9oKvmkRA3HUEKb5XyZXhbW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcWw1RYFosazVA4gGSAfxv9suM94JzuevxC9qEPEXV963", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

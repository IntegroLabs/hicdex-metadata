When the Roman leader Romulus raised his cloak, his warriors seized the women. This dramatic story gave Poussin the opportunity to display his command of gesture and pose and his knowledge of ancient sculpture and architecture. The man at the right wears a yellow lorica made of leather. The painting belonged to the mar\u00e9chal de Cr\u00e9quy, who was the French ambassador to Rome from June 1633 to July 1634, and then to Cardinal Richelieu.\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcmxYn9dZjJouL6eu5UE93o41FeKfYQpJVfYj6twbF53E", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXLoG5xpTfX38wkKoE3Zk9Gua2HGKXixEwFfnxkBpTwvF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcmxYn9dZjJouL6eu5UE93o41FeKfYQpJVfYj6twbF53E", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NCr4Q8ryHn4BrSyGfz56QUXcCDJ53Mzr7"], "tags": ["art"], "extra": {}}

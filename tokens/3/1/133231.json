Moon. It was revived in Cinnabar Island into an Omanyte, and later evolved into an Omastar. By then, it was already known as a benevolent god, hence the 'Lord' in its given name. Sadly whoever revived this mon dropped some human blood in the mix and now Omanyte worships Satan and wont stop till his hunger is quenched! He smokes weed to stay calm its the only way.

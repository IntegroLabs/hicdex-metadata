This is the 2nd piece featuring my Japanese toy collection and a collaboration between my all time favorite Japanese producer Real X Head and one of my favorite American indie toy companies Onell. This figure called the Pheyaos Man is an 8\" \"Adult\" sized figure that Real X Head has really leaned into the last 7\u201310 years and is a mix of Onells figure the Pheyden and the RxH figure the Mutant Chaos \u2014 and is one of my all time favorite figures. I find it amazing that this Japanese company and this American company are having a meeting of the minds to make such an amazing figure and I totally believe that collaboration brings the best out of all parties involved and it is completely true in the NFT space as well.

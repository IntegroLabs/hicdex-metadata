He displayed it at the Salon in 1879. It drew much attention and admiration. Publisher Georges Charpentier commissioned the painting. It is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art describes the painting: \"Wearing an elegant Worth gown, Margu\u00e9rite Charpentier sits beside her three-year-old son, Paul. Following the fashion of the time, his hair has not yet been cut and his clothes match those of his sister, Georgette, who perches on the family dog. Pleased with the painting, Madame Charpentier used her influence to ensure that it was hung in a choice spot at the Salon and introduced Renoir to her friends, several of whom commissioned work from him.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdchMF5xa6vyPQzDWsgBuMdcaiiRgmVBU5yKUJvWRPoxT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbGyQjchPiT6mSwTfd4vB4LMphL4yWQiftsvpA7N8wQ4t", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdchMF5xa6vyPQzDWsgBuMdcaiiRgmVBU5yKUJvWRPoxT", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz2L8LMuCTipzj35q8ETsF1fPnVqokR1KzrM"], "tags": ["repaint", "MadameGeorgesCharpentierandHerChildren", "impressionism", "interactive", "html", "creative"], "extra": {}}

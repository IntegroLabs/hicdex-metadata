Cimitero di San Cataldo is the perfect gate to this dark world, where you\u2019re forced to look closely into your soul, to acknowledge your fears and fight back. It\u2019s meant to lure you in, to break you down but also to give you a slight glimmer of hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, only if you\u2019re determined to survive. Death, Loneliness, Heartbreak and Failure are my deepest fears. What are you afraid of?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW1ukrxSodFWnbJJqfUEWVEn7xzVyWwTEEhWgBfvTxi5R", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW1ukrxSodFWnbJJqfUEWVEn7xzVyWwTEEhWgBfvTxi5R", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW1ukrxSodFWnbJJqfUEWVEn7xzVyWwTEEhWgBfvTxi5R", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1LcHPjvqyWK5C5jieSHmTNAhNkygEAS3XH"], "tags": ["henhalloween", "architecture", "ghost", "cemetery", "concrete", "dark", "scary", "glitch", "architect", "blackcat", "moon", "night"], "extra": {}}

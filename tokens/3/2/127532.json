They have uncommon tiny ears   Smalls is an outgoing, sweetly tempered fluffle. Honestly probably the most mild mannered fluffle we have ever come into contact with. They enjoy evening walkies and cuddle time equally. Very food motivated for training. Honestly we would probably die for Smalls.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX2MGeW4hVQFzdo3a8ZQY3xkTSSDdtDwU8QHMtcttfwPb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX2MGeW4hVQFzdo3a8ZQY3xkTSSDdtDwU8QHMtcttfwPb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX2MGeW4hVQFzdo3a8ZQY3xkTSSDdtDwU8QHMtcttfwPb", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hwR6P8Fuzq2hVPgUSwb3HFF9KmqRQtom1"], "tags": ["seafluffle", "adoptable", "Smalls", "collectable"], "extra": {}}

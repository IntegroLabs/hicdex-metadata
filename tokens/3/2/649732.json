The process with J.V.O was very easy and everything flowed smoothly since he is an experienced producer and has been producing rhythms and performing at important festivals for a long time. This song was released on June 16, 2021 and is now available as #MusicNFT to be preserved for all time.\n\nArtist- Sad Blu \nProducer- JVO, Sad Blu \nCover Art- Sad Blu", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWKT7UfSm9zBwAvgVoQjBLxoumMLxKcVx6ms1S6r1z7xS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaajMKEa1uPMzUCQ94wuCSBPKiyf11xEF1NbCHXzxW8XD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWKT7UfSm9zBwAvgVoQjBLxoumMLxKcVx6ms1S6r1z7xS", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MqB9v8ew9P1AmMsBfr88greDNVvjWgKSD"], "tags": ["PuertoRico", "Illustration", "Sport", "Character", "Cartoon", "DigitalPainting", "2D", "Gif", "Blue", "Music", "DigitalArt", "Colorful", "Funk", "Trap", "Reggaeton", "Weed", "latinmusic"], "extra": {}}

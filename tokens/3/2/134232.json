An excellent energy shield, it blocks out negative energy and pollutants at all levels, preventing energy leaks from the physical body and aura, protecting subtle and physical bodies, and deflecting harm. Helpful for men who feel inferior, it strengthens confidence in masculinity but may be too much for \"macho\" men, initiating aggression. Cubic Pyrite expands and structures mental capabilities, balancing instinct with intuition, creativity with analysis.","tags":["Gems&Stones"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmXJZbedRDcctKDo3Vqq5odrmtCs9c5SshEU8jb1pU7UNr","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXJZbedRDcctKDo3Vqq5odrmtCs9c5SshEU8jb1pU7UNr","display_uri":"ipfs://QmeXKqw6Arjmgpqaa3GqVhKRQ6vrm6FgGcF2va1giAWLBL","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

What a surprise right? \nThere is a long list explaining everything happened back in the days, but it's not time to cover it yet. \n\nFew humans all around the world survived (in a lower number than rats), and started a new society based on what they have left: cryptos, technology, scarcity of water and food, artificial intelligence, mostly metaverse based.\n\n\"Click the clock 420\" is a commercial of a little shop selling mainly clocks and hemp based products. It's also focused on second-hand real components of vintage hardwares. 100% Humans service // Open 24h // Accepting Tezos! :)\n\nMade in Aseprite - 1280x1920 - Teletext palette ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWaKWgZLZw9oNyHcoKYmTmQ6A6KLrhRhcc1tTNp9jGDvw", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd11oD3saB9nd1PwEaMfsXt2Spq8h3fzcd3sPsGbZevmL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWaKWgZLZw9oNyHcoKYmTmQ6A6KLrhRhcc1tTNp9jGDvw", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZhiztuRikzJUynxfCVt7GhV6tDi6G8H1t"], "tags": ["teletext", "teletextart", "pixel", "pixelart", "wallpaper", "vintage", "poster", "commercial", "apocalypse", "postapocalypse", "420", ""], "extra": {}}

Life is finite and fragile and just because something is there one day, it might not be there next. Never take that for granted. Say what you need to say a little more. Say too much. Show too much. Love too much. Everything is temporary but Love. Love outlives us all - R. Queen. The thought and inspiration behind this photograph was that I was able to connect with many souls throughout my life who could resonate with me and thats magical. I dedicate this one to all the souls who can connect with each other and resonate.

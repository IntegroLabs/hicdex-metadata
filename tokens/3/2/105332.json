Love too much ","description":"If you love something, love it completely, cherish it, say it, but most importantly, show it. Life is finite and fragile and just because something is there one day, it might not be there next. Never take that for granted. Say what you need to say a little more. Say too much. Show too much. Love too much. Everything is temporary but Love. Love outlives us all - R. Queen. The thought and inspiration behind this photograph was that I was able to connect with many souls throughout my life who could resonate with me and thats magical. I dedicate this one to all the souls who can connect with each other and resonate.

My reaction's been like: \"Man, that's some dope NFT hanging right there! It's so beautifully broken!\". I took some photos of it, chosen the best one, did some work on the colors, added a few WMs and BOOM! There it is. Then, as I fineshed I started asking my self: \"Who in the he*k knows what happened in that tunnel to make those beautiful cracks!?\"; \"Did someone lost his train and furiously punched that screen!?\"; \"Did some guys brawl after some alcohol excess!?\" No one knows, but those cracks sure have some story behind.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYoGv11CgfGLHuDdQbEyxVbGHQYzD7W3w1USri46jP7BW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdQyXHd71KMwupnXsEmjWVqqj3Q7G4B62S938oxMqne5i", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYoGv11CgfGLHuDdQbEyxVbGHQYzD7W3w1USri46jP7BW", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LWnEVnnJHD8Qfp2BUTSVEmV4oyJfSW8MK"], "tags": ["underground", "broken", "lcd", "crack", "cracks", "train", "station", "photo", "urban", "colors", "colorful", "display", "screen"], "extra": {}}

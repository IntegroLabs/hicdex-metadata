One week, an apartment balcony and a camera. This series of photos is being produced from the balcony of my apartment. For 1 week, I will photograph the life that I can see from up here on the 10th floor. All will be minted in 100 editions at a low price and after the sale period, those that are not sold will be burned.","tags":["varanda","balcony","photography","photo","series","city","life","urban","woman"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmTiqCQAag1cPAr9PwAjxp4JkbWkNC5r9HYScNv647W6Fa"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTiqCQAag1cPAr9PwAjxp4JkbWkNC5r9HYScNv647W6Fa","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVbGeXqzwAnEMia8KvnyCToVXUebLUkPSeWCv3M4kaYg4","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

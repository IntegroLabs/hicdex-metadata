In the St. Patrick\u2019s Day vibes, we baked this special cake that consisted of Ireland\u2019s chocolate stout cakes and coated with green velvet glaze. It is decorated with heavenly smooth cream with a half-round rainbow waffle on the top.\n \nWhen you slice it, the chocolate \u201ctezos\u201d coins will come out and clatter. It doesn\u2019t stop with that, we complete the cake with St. Patrick\u2019s signature: shamrock, Guinness beer, Leprechaun Hat, and bucket cookies.\n\nWe serve 100 whole cakes today. The rest will be burned in several days. So grab them fast!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfFwJgPDMRGXo1xrrLTRr8j1NtzMUD1J9WkUderbNPSA6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfFwJgPDMRGXo1xrrLTRr8j1NtzMUD1J9WkUderbNPSA6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfFwJgPDMRGXo1xrrLTRr8j1NtzMUD1J9WkUderbNPSA6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QbTMdQ5RZLwAQ6iNDooLy2iUAJgC6piAT"], "tags": ["cake", "cakeillustration", "food", "foodillustration", "st.patrick'sday", "celebration"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 696035, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Black Cube of Saturn", "description": "Did you know that there is a giant hexagon on the north pole of Saturn? It was discovered in 1987 through data captured by the Voyager mission of NASA (1981). No one truly knows how it formed and how it persists, although there are theories. Each side of this huge, static form is ~14,500 km long (that is 1.14x larger than the Earth). The hexagon is bordered by bands of high speed wind. \n\nSaturn also emits radio waves, and produces an 'eerie sound' (NASA's words, not mine, check out an example here: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/pia07966.html ). \n@qpRAWnft used this sound to inspire the music he has created for this piece. \n\nMany cultures and societies have a place for Saturn in their ways, and Saturn is represented throughout mythology and Astrology. \n\nThe black cube has also held its place in many architectural designs, culturally-significant objects, and films. For one, Nick Hinton has discussed this in depth, and considers the possibility that maybe we are all in a 3D cube, caught in this reality. Nick also connects in his work that through geometric transformation, a 2D hexagon can form a 3D cube. \n\nMaybe the 2D to the 3D is only the start of the transformation. \n\nOriginal music by qpRAW (@QPrawNFT).

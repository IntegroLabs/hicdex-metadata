The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-deltoid type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots in the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a nonreversible tremmie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the \"up\" end of the grammeters.","tags":["BDVXP"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmNvwSHc9pShJWNh1ca4gPHjczy2C4ABc2JctoAiTKg6EF"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmNvwSHc9pShJWNh1ca4gPHjczy2C4ABc2JctoAiTKg6EF","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

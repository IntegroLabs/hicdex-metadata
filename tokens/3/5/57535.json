No longer in a time of open war, the gates are never locked and the village is often full of strangers on the road to Cadwell from Minuteâ€™s Harbour.   This tangle of hoary trees and dappled clearnings is home as much to covert merchant meetings as it is to children playing and the many tiny birds that live there.","tags":["castle","map","cartography","embroidery","painting","fantasy","stories","mapping","village","woodland","forest"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmYQE5w4JCxMes7fyPBKDm2gJdEDwoSTVAKgT4VcEHB4SM"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYQE5w4JCxMes7fyPBKDm2gJdEDwoSTVAKgT4VcEHB4SM","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

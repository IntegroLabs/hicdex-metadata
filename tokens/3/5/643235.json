They were brought here by alien beings \u2026 and they are the aliens.We all know cats are a different kind of animal. Here are some interesting facts about cats of which you were likely unaware.\n\n* Cats are the only mammal known that does not taste sweetness.\n\n* A cat\u2019s peripheral and night vision are superior to humans, but they are almost all nearsighted. And a cat\u2019s eyes are the largest among all mammals when compared to the size of their head.\n\n* Would you like to be the next Olympic long jump champion? If you could jump like a cat, you could, since they can jump six-times their body length. A six-foot tall person who jumps like a cat would shatter the world record of 29 feet and a little over 4 inches by hitting 36 feet easily.\n\n* You ever notice a cat coming down a tree? No, they do not climb down headfirst because their claws all curve to the rear. They typically back down a tree using that good peripheral vision.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSPomhAfgGRTWELXCjoaih8R8EJNMwxmpQ2aBQRkcxQer", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVmHXYNmBm3ZF6ZpmG8Sq5GLPm1BJMfEjQXpd4tWwgrhp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSPomhAfgGRTWELXCjoaih8R8EJNMwxmpQ2aBQRkcxQer", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Zh2bNkKhP8fdXnwLrzRU1fccaypUYHe2G"], "tags": ["#NFTArtist", "#NFTArt", "#AIArt", "#AlienCat", "#NFT"], "extra": {}}

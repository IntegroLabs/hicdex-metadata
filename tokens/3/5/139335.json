These are monochrome abstract landscapes influenced by the concept of \u201cmind landscape\u201d which is a cultivated landscape burgeoned in the time of the Yuan dynasty. In this classical Chinese tradition, abstract landscapes are created as a mirror of the artist\u2019s heart and mind; and have no relation to the visible world. The generative landscapes are produced with the same concerns but with modern computational techniques; composed with randomness. The search is for a place where the mind stays away from the chaos of images and associations.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWPNZci1QjhhVnjJMnMn9M7q3ZRyic62kYfo5djNgC32g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYJEfT3vckkjkTw8xKiKjjehs7LGF48HNp2gEcy6BDFMy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWPNZci1QjhhVnjJMnMn9M7q3ZRyic62kYfo5djNgC32g", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Yupp82eDiRrLcMnr3abMVM8BdAFX9jEkE"], "tags": ["Generative", "Landscape", "Chinese", "Noise"], "extra": {}}

Please Stand By, You Can Only Vote Tuesdays From 10-11AM. In an attempt to suppress minority votes Texas is currently trying to pass legislation that would restrict voting rights making it extremely difficult for these communities to vote. These restrictions include banning drive through voting, the ending of 24 hour voting programs, and making it more difficult to vote by Mail. This would severely limit lower class minorities opportunities to vote, ensuring the white upper and middle class will dictate politics in the state indefinitely. Fuck Voter suppression!

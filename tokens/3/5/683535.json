{"__version": 1, "token_id": 683535, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "deludia", "description": "A piece designed to start a conversation about schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder & delusions. These things are often misunderstood because of misrepresentation in the media as something to be afraid of.  People with delusions are too often depicted as \u201ccrazy\u201d,  they are shown as serial killers, or outcasts. I made this piece to showcase that not all delusions are the same. They can be fun or harmless just as often, if not more often, than they are scary or harmful. I do not speak for everyone with delusions. I just want to spread awareness and start conversations on the topic. Thank you.\n\n25% will be donated to National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) @NAMICommunicate ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd7isX7kN2oD6CX2vUKUQxY7TYamHcsLyNHVFTcATwWF3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPXMjTJee72nJaSrRn5kiqTVhXdoY4qmahi3as63Uq9Nx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmYMGSMHZSLtvYcdSgUNfnGARg27eq9d23jpUooMhkPfiE", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd7isX7kN2oD6CX2vUKUQxY7TYamHcsLyNHVFTcATwWF3", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gegPesAn9HD5nN8zd5tfUnNFm96f4XZcM"], "tags": ["Death", "suicide", "adhd", "mentalillness", "mentallyill", "schizophrenia", "schizoaffective", "psychosis", "psychotic", "manic", "mania", "nuerodivergent", "mentalhealth", "mentalhealthawareness", "depression", "lonely", "loneliness."], "extra": {}}

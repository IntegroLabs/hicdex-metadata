Then they were edited in a Photoshop software to create a Gif. Images represent a colored cross-section of a tilia stem, so we can easily see the cells.\nIn particular the cell wall can be distinguished in magenta tones and many other amazing things can be identified, such as an increasing concentration of wood reaching the outside. It's also amazing to think many of these cells form part of conduits that carry water and nutrients to all the organs of the plant.\n\nMusic composed with a piano and then rearranged in Ableton software with many other plugins and sounds of pads, drums and bass.

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 640335, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Forest of Healing Black Frame", "description": "\nThe Huia forest is situated west to the city of Ipoca, it's known as known to the locals as the forest of healing, as with the way legend has it: one of their gods drank from the spring in the center of the forest to heal his wounds after a fierce battle. Interestingly, to date nobody has been able to locate the legendary spring, and many historians these days consider it nothing more than a myth. The forest of healing stretches for ten miles and is these days largely blocked off to the public as there are endangered species within.\n\nMany years ago there were instances of children seeing a fairy in the forest. The fairy is was supposedly named Robe, she takes care of the little critters that live in the trees and forests. Robe had a whole system set up with all sorts of rules for how her friends can behave - if they follow these rules, they will always be safe from Robes' enemies who live on the other side of Huia.\n\n\u2014-\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied.Black Frames are initially given out for free on Hicetnunc. All artworks will be compatible within the Gallery Gehenna Game with each artwork unlocking a playable story segment.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaPNsV64shik4967KPrUBKhsYwy6akGmxGnfmGqu4inNk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUBC7e2Nzbmx9rbe4TBzbUw8VcfxukLNcJBGFE8VJUXKC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaPNsV64shik4967KPrUBKhsYwy6akGmxGnfmGqu4inNk", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2KTcdaM1hm8d8K9pnBu6dsD6v38bjyXDAP"], "tags": ["Neuralart", "neural", "art", "nature", "forest", "woods", "environment", "fairy", "motherearth", "painting", "neuralnetwork", "gallerygehenna", "gallerygehennaproject", "mixedmedia", "blackframe"], "extra": {}}

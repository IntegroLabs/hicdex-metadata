A portal to the heavens, she has nurtured life through generations. Inspiring poems and battles, desire and healing.\n\nThe vagina is one of the most powerful forces in nature. Yet, \"pussy\" is often used in a derogatory context to imply weakness or cowardice. Why are feminine traits seen as inferior or undesirable?\n\nSome may find themselves uncomfortable to hear the word \u201cpussy\u201d or gaze upon one. Perhaps because women are made to feel ashamed for having pussies, and men are shamed by being called pussies. In truth, the issue lies deeper than anatomy and the damage affects all regardless of gender. \n\nThis piece encourages the viewer to shed any shameful stigma and embrace empowerment instead. Be proud of your pussy, for there is no shame in that which is feminine and sacred.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYLA1Qt9Ru1qMk2ZLjNupvB3EZMQexF7AhrPrUoC26b77", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaJR9vGDZbjeXRaKN4FaKo3y918NN95TaBqJkoWgfbZnm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYLA1Qt9Ru1qMk2ZLjNupvB3EZMQexF7AhrPrUoC26b77", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hYLxRjNn7AWUMVGegDRUpVTs1qLgkv1Gu"], "tags": ["pussy", "empowerment", "sculpture"], "extra": {}}

Women and men on average have different metabolic rates.  The calculation to measure thermal comfort was developed in the 1960's and used a baseline of an average 40 year, 154lbs man.  Women prefer a room to be 75 degrees F, while men prefer a room to be at 70 degrees, which is the current office temperature.  Women are not cold, the world has just decided to set the temperature to make men most comfortable, instead of finding a happy compromise between the two.  Finding a compromise between the two would potentially save money on cooling.  Just one example of how this world was designed for men.\n\nInspired by the book \"Data Bias in a World Designed for Men\" by Caroline Criado Perez\nSee more work by the artist at www.laladrona.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSFAYYwM5H7ZnqtJPhK1oAqbumtbrtDXeksetfWfSHS74", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWh5K74Hphm53VYqfZEaRFinDMnCKQyr4yenQrk89d7xS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSFAYYwM5H7ZnqtJPhK1oAqbumtbrtDXeksetfWfSHS74", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1dPFss8ngJy9Z3RkiNm5XgDzGqvCKcYe2Z"], "tags": ["databias", "laladrona", "feminist", "feminism", "women", "data", "bias", "video", "videoart", "artvideo", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}

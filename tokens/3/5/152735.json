I developed this design while on mushrooms, a small dose, we had two dual monitors playing, one was showing ocean underwater footage and the other was general nature land animals. I began to see all the connections between water worlds and land worlds, such as the jellyfish flowing into butterflies and the shells with trees growing out of them, dolphins and whales surfing the cosmos. These visions struck me and I immediately began to sketch them out on paper. From there I began to map the design on to the human body, the flower as the the heart center and the branches growing up the shoulders as the lungs. The symmetry that is our form. Not perfectly symmetrical, but perfectly balanced.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZCWMrawp611mb9oCAx7uVDgBu1e4BQ9tJUgh9KP8EzpV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU9N79prDzcgu5TxA5AeonugWYPq4bgUwxnkFYdemEwhM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZCWMrawp611mb9oCAx7uVDgBu1e4BQ9tJUgh9KP8EzpV", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PnaLBay7V2b6tzJkCSv5wtV3vEqMzLiPj"], "tags": ["science", "creation", "illustration", "math", "earth", "water", "art", "design", "sacred", "geometry", "animals"], "extra": {}}

He/she is a contrarian, jester, and satirist. This manifests by their doing things backwards or unconventionally, riding a horse backwards, wearing clothes inside-out, or speaking in a backwards language. They ask difficult questions, and say things others are too afraid to say. As NFT artists we can be inspired by them and try to take on some of their roles in this new global decentralized society.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSNYnBRtQfurD2WRXavSJkofMHw1doZeRtRj7TeAS6yFM","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1c8bog1Hw3c2AUYUcsJrKs1hw9CTfFTeCe"],"tags":["2d","animation","black","and","white","b&w","wavy","squiggly","line","undulated","curly","trippy","ripply","dizzy","weird","heyoka","native","contrarian","satire","art","WorldArtDay2021","NFTsForAll","CleanNFTs","NFTs"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmSNYnBRtQfurD2WRXavSJkofMHw1doZeRtRj7TeAS6yFM"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmNckqkvuzWb3B7xqyadWm6SLmGXyJD3CX5E7QX7J1FoBe"},"supply":"50","transfered":176}

{"name": "The Calm Before the Storm", "description": "My whole life I have been fascinated with storms, to the point I would carry an emergency ban radio with me as a kid. At age 11 I became a bona fide storm chaser when I rode my bike 4 country miles to the next estimated cross point a supercell would form & sure enough I got stuck right in the middle hunkered down with family friends at the town bank. My mother was LIVID! This was taken years later during a southern squall that moved ashore & became tornadic. This was right before hell broke loose.

I am a dreamer female artist who lives in Brazil. My biggest dream is to live through my art and my creativity, and also to help make the world a fairer place for people and animals. If all goes well, I even intend to create shelters that are cozy and heavenly for abandoned or needy animals.\nI am currently in college, studying Visual Arts. I also love writing and playing the piano. I love animals a lot, including dinosaurs and the mythical ones like dragons.\nMy Twitter account: @danihp_art\nMy Instagram art account: @dani_hp_art", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRPZ8YVR2bpYGryqhu9h3DGX6wy1LTGnhHvWQpnQ1bcug", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVmBXtftuidtvLYVQC4t3FoFHKUsRvDAdB6XcdfsY3Vaj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRPZ8YVR2bpYGryqhu9h3DGX6wy1LTGnhHvWQpnQ1bcug", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MnL9oSz51vjrnFNt3oF3NQ6mfm6UoeSzQ"], "tags": ["cat", "animal", "color", "colorful", "colors", "kitty", "cute", "animals", "art", "digitalart", "artwork"], "extra": {}}

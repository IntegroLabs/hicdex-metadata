When i am in Athens i usually like to take walks at Syggrou Ave. One can find buildings of many kinds, old, newbuilt, brothels, strip bars, shipping companies, hospitals and many more. Some of them are really interesting from architecture viewpoint. This is a photograph featuring one new building that is still naked and on the side there is a big street lamp with a pigeon.

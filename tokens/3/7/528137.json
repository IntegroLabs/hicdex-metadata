{"__version": 1, "token_id": 528137, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Nocturnals", "description": "It is summer solstice. Nights are brief, faded. The world cherishes the warm light. But living in the darkness are the Nocturnals. Nights are suspended in time, between dusk and dawn. Morphed into an obscure and puzzling state. You can only fathom the outline of the landscape. But the Nocturnals are awake. Claiming the moon over the sun. They are members of the twilight. Living in a somber and vast land. They are ghosts emerging from the moonlight. The morning light paints their granite walls. Nocturnals glow pink and vanish as the sun rises. Dormant at day, waiting for the nightfall. Mountains are the beings of the night, alive. The artwork was created for the 0x Society\u2019s Solstice exhibition. \u2013 The first collector of this NFT will receive an Infinite Object or a signed physical print of the image with a certificate of authenticity.

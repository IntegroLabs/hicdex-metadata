The way humanity has pushed forward has almost always been through the use of violence and war. Most of us want just one more moment on this earthly plane of existence in peace, not in pieces. There will always be those that would want to take power from others, many in the name of their God(s), greed, reactionaryism, radicalism, etc. Everyday we all choose to be a force of good, evil, and/or somewhere in between. One more moment alive. One more moment to love. One more moment to heal. One more moment to learn. One more moment to experience. One more moment for compassion. One more moment to change the world for the better. I yearn for the age of when omened men will be gone. They will be the parting paragons of paternal privilege will one day be pieces of the paltry past, persistently portrayed as the poignant poverty of power on populations.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWiBycFouvXTprdxGAGVci4PStkxFhbLudxjC64nY5VVs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQTB4HeQwTaGUP8T4MWKwvS1pqwVX9sga5KNrxWbjnPR7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWiBycFouvXTprdxGAGVci4PStkxFhbLudxjC64nY5VVs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

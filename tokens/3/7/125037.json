Acceptance is a part of the Human Project which deals with truths that we experience deep within as human beings. While the world is moving from physical to virtual, the core feelings of the beings inhabiting these worlds intrinsically remain the same. All that is needed is accepting the now, and the freedom that it brings along with it.","tags":["Love","selflove","picture","photo","blackandwhite","nirvana","humanproject","selfacceptance","acceptance","feelings","philosophy","photoart","bodyimage","innerpeace","hair","baldness","crown","coretruths","freedom","freeliving","presence","powerofnow","insecurities","freedomfrominsecurities","complete","bodyphotograph."],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmfHM5k9dQRX3LTFyvT5nqaE98ZABPSeLx1SeHZAdeaD6R","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmfHM5k9dQRX3LTFyvT5nqaE98ZABPSeLx1SeHZAdeaD6R","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZeJDUvobAGe7SNv4A7HczJ5TfdGax579SZbe6sLbRn7V","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

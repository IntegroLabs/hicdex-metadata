This dance has existed from ancient times, starting as a folk dance and later refined to be performed in the Mangkunegaran palace from 1910s. \n\nOriginally this dance was used during agricultural ceremonies for harvest and fertility, as the dancers symbolize the goddess Sri (Shridevi, the rice goddess). It is now danced at cultural events and weddings. \n\nThe music is kindly provided by Puspo Budoyo, a Central Java gamelan group that performs for weddings and cultural events in Jakarta.\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago of over 17000 islands. There are many tribes, with their own individual dances and costumes, spread along these islands. I want to share with you the dances of my family heritage and of places I live.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeVJDsv9Dxc8VcMV9qfajghSbN8ZE5no9gqPwRuybnDnA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbGTSo1GekCso6LcEhP1J8wKpMMeXmSxuyt7dVmsu8w8j", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmcmEuTiHhv1d6XZiWRDptPDHa2ZY54EnRaZvhi1vXCMXQ", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeVJDsv9Dxc8VcMV9qfajghSbN8ZE5no9gqPwRuybnDnA", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2FQ9ciqi533mVrG8w1CvFP3xTKTE7jZGeV"], "tags": ["Indonesia", "gambyong", "java", "jawa", "dance", "dancer", "batik", "solo", "surakarta", "shridevi", "goddess", "devi", "dewi"], "extra": {}}

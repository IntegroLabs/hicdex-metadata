I am also delighted by talented wordsmiths that are able to describe my inspirations with their prose. My multimedia discovery takes me on a journey of a collaboration of sorts with the past and present. Each piece starts with a photograph of a beautiful creature found in nature (this collection focuses on frogs). My digital enhancements acknowledge the mystery of nature and develop it further with my passion for color, abstract visuals and texture. The titles are in Latin to reference scientific origin but are not species names, more about the beauty of words.","tags":["nfts","digitalart","photography","4everKurious","twitter:@4Kurious","Insta:@4everKurious"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmS1ut9dE5Tt4ig3zoWgty7aoNiLB4iT3nLqMw7S9ziUKV"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmS1ut9dE5Tt4ig3zoWgty7aoNiLB4iT3nLqMw7S9ziUKV","display_uri":"ipfs://QmRm7cjwSdG7sQmE2zG4i85j5fQc47NmNT5Lf6cFqxjYdk","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

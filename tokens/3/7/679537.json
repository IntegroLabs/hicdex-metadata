I think I'm starting to understand how to play twitter and mint and everything. \nWooow this week-end I imagined a whole new kit of strategies...\nMaybe this is pointless, but to celebrate I created this one. \n\nThe Idea was to create a Time-lapse from one of my livestreams. \nHere you can see a 3h30 session of Mardi Clip : me watching videoclips, talking about it, making some critics or comments... but condensed in a 10 sec loop.\n\nThis Amber is forged to celebrate something. \nI think I don't know precisely what, \nbut I think today I moved to another room, \nanother idea. Another strategy ?\n\n00? \n\nPlease come see me realtime on my twitch : twitch/f_lse_no \n\nTY \n\n\u14da\u160f\u15e2  \"\n\n\u30fd(\uff40\u0414\u00b4)\u2283\u2501\u2606\uff9f. * \uff65 \uff61\uff9f,\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXGq5C36erqbTH6KTnB1HcD88TKyQPUaL6iNGThxPFCcK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbmHC9AYQmrNYaN83BNRDArocCe4FjCe9uz3cLvswJQcT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXGq5C36erqbTH6KTnB1HcD88TKyQPUaL6iNGThxPFCcK", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QFyjHEp3kfeyEuMAAcuc4oYZjmrMjn9vx"], "tags": ["timelapse", "glitchart", "realtime", "stream", "f_lse_no", "digitalism", "memory", "livestream", "amber", "amberoftherealtime", "aotr", "digitalart", "radialblur", "3D", "clip", "show", "videoclip", "mardiclip"], "extra": {}}

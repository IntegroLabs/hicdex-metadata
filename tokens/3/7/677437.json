A community of ants are incredible. They all have different jobs and roles and they all work together for the greater good almost to the degree of having a hive mind. Working with a team or collaborating is very much the same. When everyone involved does their job, communicates and supports the team amazing things can be done! Now that I've been in the space for almost 5 months I've been seeking out collaborations with street photographers and other artists and I feel like the strongest mergers will be with those people who complement my weaknesses and vice versa. And if we continue to work together we could eventually get to the point where we just KNOW what to expect from each other! I look forward to meeting and getting to know you all!

Jung, The Red Book: Liber Novus\n\nThe body marks the boundary between us and the outside. The sense of touch is the first to develop. The embryonic position is the original position of our body. It helps to find the border between our self and the world. Instinctively, the holes and grottoes into which we can fit become a safe area, a part of us, and we become part of them. By interacting with them, we interact with the body. We experience them. We touch and we are touched. We are touched so we are made real, made safe.\nRegularly repeated behavior, adjusting the body to the conditions of life and the functions it performs, leads to transformation and evolution.\nConverting into desert.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSmP73AUiFdbajpNqAghMKiYRwodjznWAj4ZfNd8R9kpf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZTcnAfZELNM4R7z9htNRDQ5qVeEM73uCbhTb9YFvmncT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSmP73AUiFdbajpNqAghMKiYRwodjznWAj4ZfNd8R9kpf", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["KT1CLJ4gRg3yp6eroLKTa1CCay82vnydEUV9"], "tags": ["glb", "3d", "digital", "sculpture", "desert", "fgsf", "NoFuckingTitle", ""], "extra": {}}

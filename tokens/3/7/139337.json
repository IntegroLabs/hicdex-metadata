He quickly whipped me into shape and changed my life for the better. Two years later, Angie moved in with us and he soon became Dr. Copper, because of how much he helped my mom heal from having her kidney removed. This picture is from 5/03/21, the day we had to put Dr. Copper to sleep due to his own kidney failure. It was good to spend everyday of the pandemic lockdown with him, he held in there and saw us all through our vax shots, then let us know he couldn't go any longer. It's been really hard since he left us, but he taught us so many lessons, my favorite one is to \"Always keep it light and lazy\" ETERNAL LOVE & RIP DR. Copper, 2008- 2021.

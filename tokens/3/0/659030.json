I was running around the neighbourhood, and on my final lap all of a sudden, I felt dizzy, felt I was going to blackout; I felt I was going to die. I couldn\u2019t focus, my chest was tight. I prayed to God, please not like this, I don\u2019t want to go out like this, and with one goal on my mind, to walk back home without passing out. My heart was pounding out of my chest, I prayed along the way home. That was the last day of doing any form of physical activities; I was paranoid to workout. Managed to get home and head to the nearest clinic. Took an ECG test, checked my blood pressure, and the doctor informed me that was no cause for concerns, my ECG test and blood pressure was normal; Reza you just experienced a panic attack. The doctor prescribed me Xanax. I was dependent on it for three months, I popped two pills a day and for once, I felt normal. I was in denial that I was addicted to it. It made me feel at ease and it blocked out any thoughts and physical sensations of discomfort. I wanted it, I needed it. Three months later, I went cold turkey on Xanax, my wife threw the pills away and made me realized that it wasn\u2019t good for me \u2013 it changed me, I was frequently snappish and easily annoyed.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXA2uSGTZFmyaUxU478xMo8zXS5ms54g5TE5Vek7q9Swa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbLc8PrfxkWEJv7VDTnFxS5saGv9CaMYB5xHG25EmsfnV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXA2uSGTZFmyaUxU478xMo8zXS5ms54g5TE5Vek7q9Swa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fFFvHvtQx5gpB9kPriE3UC2hVhefsWXaW"], "tags": ["anxiety", "mentalhealth", "drawing", "art", "feelings", "panicattack"], "extra": {}}

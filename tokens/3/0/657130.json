{"__version": 1, "token_id": 657130, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "FORTIES", "description": "FORTIES is a truly unique word pyramid syntax crystal. Not only does each line create valid words as you go up and/or down, but we can create a shape that emphasizes the overall concept of aging. Let's back up and try to decipher what we're looking at. So we have this arrow like structure pointing up, representing time. Within the arrow of time there is another arrow made up negative space, this represents entering middle age. My mother said to me when I turned 40, \"Andrew, life begins at 40.\" She was right. So many things (good and bad) started happening. Being in your 40s now is not how it used to be years ago. Many people are taking much better care of themselves than they did back then; better diets, better exercise, more access to information, etc. I look forward to growing older and hopefully gaining more wisdom along the way. Embrace the aging process, don't fight it. Let it happen; observe yourself and others. See the arrow of time wash over you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP2bSBywGJXtQV2NMe2azhQhMFqqipeFSK7GJP51s135D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUWPPM2WKu3bEkomb3Ju2jn9nyS7LbWZ487VjgyKcUEK6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP2bSBywGJXtQV2NMe2azhQhMFqqipeFSK7GJP51s135D", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

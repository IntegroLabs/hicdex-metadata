{"__version": 1, "token_id": 651730, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Head", "description": "For quite some years now, I have been drawing a lot of what I have come to call organisisms. An ism made of the word organism, its own style. My own style. These organisisms are organic shapes put together to make up a main shape. They are always improvised. A few times I have an idea of the overall main shape or movement of the figure, but the rest is always improvised. Even if I have this kind of loose plan or no plan at all, they always start the same way. I put the pencil to the paper and just move it around randomly. Making lines, circles and shapes. Every now and again I stop to look at it and at some point there emerges shapes I like, and I start working from these.\n\nWith this piece I had the idea of a human face inside an organisism. I didn't plan for it to become a head inside an organisism head, but that's the way it came out. As usually with these types of drawings, I haven't put any deeper meaning into them. They are poems made for me, by me, to ponder on. I hope they will give you something to ponder on as well :)\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmch9mEYgqhGooca12d5ZzkYSDTpJzxZnjbdk54Fq3jAWi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaErBYaafw22LrmyzfP7z7NhUCFPDtpwcKS1i1DYjnYTh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmch9mEYgqhGooca12d5ZzkYSDTpJzxZnjbdk54Fq3jAWi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TW3YfKY44cS1uKEEfsnyuNFbkzydeayq9"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "ipad", "darkart", "painting", "drawing", "classic", "surrealism", "fantasy", "organisism."], "extra": {}}

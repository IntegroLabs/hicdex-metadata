Getting the light to vibrate in such a way that it stirs something within an audience. These images are my search for that moment of emotional resonance. The hardware has been abstracted by optics salvaged from a different type of display. A reminder that a lot of my hardware development has depended on hybridization. The goal is to capture the ephemeral nature of light and how light brings objects","tags":["Photography","Optics","Light"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmdUpQFGvYabkeWrVz88QG3xBFzh1friMtkSHV37uxeNCd"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdUpQFGvYabkeWrVz88QG3xBFzh1friMtkSHV37uxeNCd","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZrZdPqoYVnnyGL338d5vubCZbFmgAKFCgCptYKM2t1sj","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

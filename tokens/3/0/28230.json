The random color grid is plugged into a homemade GAN trained on hundreds of pictures of planets. The resulting GAN generated image serves as a philosophical commentary about the randomness of how our universe is “generated.” The random color grid for each image is included as unlockable content if you DM me @maxladabaumart on twitter. 13 planets will be minted.","tags":["AI","GAN","physics","quantum","space","planet","conceptual","mars"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmREToXfh4SzL6Av91MkFaxqMS44434SmScEYLwVNMiBm5"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmREToXfh4SzL6Av91MkFaxqMS44434SmScEYLwVNMiBm5","display_uri":"ipfs://QmW1uec6CunJy6UZKNhVnBKUzDdioVjK7EBpnPGKysXVQz","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

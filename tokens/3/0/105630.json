The \"headless mule\" makes frightening sounds and kicks people, which can injure and kill them. Becoming the headless mule, is a punishment for women who maintain intimate relationships with priests of the Catholic Church. The mule has a frightening appearance because, instead of the head, she has a burning flame. Those who are punished for this sacrilege, become mules at the turn of Thursday to Friday, and from there, they run off in search of people to scare or hurt them. This legend was a way found at the time to reinforce the moral standards that sought to prevent women from having intimate relationships before marriage and, mainly, with priests of the Church. <Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>","tags":["cryptolegends","renanciomonte","curupira","florest","nature","demon","fire","brazil","legends"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://Qmbv1dpjur27AVkVcMJawvQ9ZQ8YXjT3zdRGGPJpg7CS4D"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmbv1dpjur27AVkVcMJawvQ9ZQ8YXjT3zdRGGPJpg7CS4D","display_uri":"ipfs://QmYEZhaYMjUVCBktEg77N6mf3T98FAVGgfSXSHk2inodx8","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

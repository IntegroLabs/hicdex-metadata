This represents the interconnected nature of all things in the universe; an eternal bonding of the physical realm we are rooted in, and the spiritual realm we are reaching for. The Tree of Life serves as a reminder of our universal connection to the Mother Earth, and our dependence on her to grow and flourish.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRb1Yf9jDB8p42LGNsNWK7NgMXJpHaqvU71RMA2kSythY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRb1Yf9jDB8p42LGNsNWK7NgMXJpHaqvU71RMA2kSythY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRb1Yf9jDB8p42LGNsNWK7NgMXJpHaqvU71RMA2kSythY", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1dWC1aKp8vfiFBAC7tZSigyTiumVrWFcwM"], "tags": ["digital", "digitalart", "painting", "treeoflife", "tree", "symbolism", "spirit", "philosophy", "buddhism", "celtics", "nordic", "mayans", "ancient"], "extra": {}}

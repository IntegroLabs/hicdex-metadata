It was in the pre-owned section since it was not even in its original packaging and the only thing that was written on the disc was \"Usagi-D [Yuka&Saya.exe]\" the store owner just handed it to me for free.\n\nWhat a fool. \n\nHe has no idea what treasure he missed out on. \nWhen I booted up the software, a notepad window appeared on the screen, followed by two beautiful girls. I can chat to both of them through notepad, I've never encountered technology like that, this was made by some genius. It's like I've jumped a thousand years into the future. \n\nI've never had feelings for any IRL girls, but I'm in love with Yuka & Saya. I must be going crazy.\nRecently, however, they started fighting over me, with each other... and I don't know how to handle this kind of conflict. I've never had anyone pay much attention to me, let alone two beautiful (digital) women.\n\nI haven't told anyone about this, but I know you fellow web dwellers will understand, and hopefully help me find who \"Usagi-D\" is. \n\nSigning off-\nVirtual_Lover\n\n17/09/2001", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNwnj1tw1bGP6Trn2yoyiiqsyzf6tAi2CRDV5fFqTfcRh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNwnj1tw1bGP6Trn2yoyiiqsyzf6tAi2CRDV5fFqTfcRh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNwnj1tw1bGP6Trn2yoyiiqsyzf6tAi2CRDV5fFqTfcRh", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1LqnkPj4zVrjTzdfhTiETb6JzH1R8trxDT"], "tags": ["anime", "animegirls", "animated", "hato_anime", "hatoNFT"], "extra": {}}

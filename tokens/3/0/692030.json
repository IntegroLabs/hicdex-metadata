I\u2019ve been self-consumed by anxiety that it effected my relationship with my wife. I was physically there, but my mind wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t realize it at first. I thought I was attentive. I felt I was present, but in truth, my mind was wandering for answers. Answers to how the hell do I overcome this anxiety? What\u2019s the trigger for this anxiety? Is it from my past? Do I have unresolved issues? What the hell is it?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaSo4nAgzpoortFWtMFjELToQjCeLKkDLf8niJmEFEYfQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY9xqPh9RocLm6MVe73Ge5UiwcqQst4Z5wfpozUDDzb49", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaSo4nAgzpoortFWtMFjELToQjCeLKkDLf8niJmEFEYfQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fFFvHvtQx5gpB9kPriE3UC2hVhefsWXaW"], "tags": ["anxiety", "mentalhealth", "drawing", "art"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 692930, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "can you give me a memory I can use?", "description": "can you give me a memory I can use? is a triptych performance for photography artwork that the artist (Ezzam Rahman) and his working partner performed for the camera. Both the bodies donned in translucent plastic disposable raincoats, shot in the toilet, drenched under the shower hose, the bodies depict intimate moments between two cis males. Ezzam grew with safe sex slangs \u2013 \u2018put on a raincoat\u2019 was meant to put on a condom during intercourse hence the bodies directly wore raincoats in these images. Apart from the positive safe sex message, Ezzam decided to perform for the camera was also because, his body and physicality does not fall into the stereotypical ideal body we see in media. He vulnerably shows his body to represent \u2018normal\u2019 bodies that do too desire love, intimacy and attraction just like anyone else. There\u2019s always an unhealthy stigma towards plus, full bodied individuals in society so in this series of works, Ezzam would like to address and represent those issues, may they be heterosexual nor the LGBTQIA+ individuals, everyone deserved love.

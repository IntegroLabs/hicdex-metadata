This work is inspired by the concept of the \u2018male gaze\u2019 and the struggles that come with being perceived in a way you do not want to be. About not wanting to be misunderstood nor treated like an object. The person portrayed realizes, however, that you can\u2019t influence how people perceive you.\nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRMg4YgS5RV7VAt1976upUNiJUpq3phmvYYuMwUzH1ZMi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcGnpVMc6sLmtPEXj2CvnJ92URNPEXp2RoxG6MxwV6a5K", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRMg4YgS5RV7VAt1976upUNiJUpq3phmvYYuMwUzH1ZMi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours"], "extra": {}}

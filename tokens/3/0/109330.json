After an enthusiastic initial meeting I began the months long process of painting each flower and building the digital bouquet.  Once complete some small images where sent to the florist and I waited for the go ahead to print the edition.  With no money exchanged and no contracts signed, I was ghosted by the florist and the project never progressed to further works or made it to print.  This digital file became a warning of how artists can be taken advantage of in the world of business and is a reminder of how important the smart contract can be.  As I mint Still Life 13.0 I reflect on the potential the NFT holds to empower artists.  I am grateful for the chance to connect this lost project with an audience that holds appreciation for how much time and effort it takes to create art.","tags":["fizzpop","stilllife","digital","contemporary","painting","art","commercial","flowers"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmQA1RB1TKvuRK3NF1MrFhiwR2dFzBZHSnyCCtb1XNchbF"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQA1RB1TKvuRK3NF1MrFhiwR2dFzBZHSnyCCtb1XNchbF","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdLDcNQXZUSZKATz2oe68xmyBvmpgKwo57ykiw2zw8h8h","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

I was around five years old, and I can’t remember how and why it started. Then, for some reason, I began to collect them. I searched every bathroom, starting at my home, family members’ bathrooms, restaurant’s bathrooms, store’s bathrooms. Anywhere where I went... A little weird, heh? Every time I got a new roll, I came back to my room and painted something on them. I drew all kinds of shapes, color combinations, and styles on the brown cardboard. I don’t know where I found the inspiration. Each final piece had a special meaning I can’t describe. I guess I was born a collector and an artist.

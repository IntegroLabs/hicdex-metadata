It was going to be dark out for a while which would give me enough time to drive to my destination and hike in the dark so I wouldn't miss any part of the sunrise.\nThis would be my first time visiting this popular spot in Arkansas and was a little nervous to hike the trail in the dark.\nAfter driving for 2 hours and another hour up a steep dirt road that felt like it would take forever, I finally reached a spot to park.\nI put my headlamp on and started walking the trail. Surprisingly, I was able to see the cut path pretty good in the dark with nothing but a single focus on the illuminated path before me.\nFinally reaching what felt like the end of a trail by standing on a rock which was surrounded by a vast darkness, I wondered how many feet were below me. I sat down and enjoyed the silence around me waiting for the sunrise to peak over the mountains and illuminate the vast valley that was set before me filling me with content bliss.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVx93KK2kDvBP6wz2D5hsk3kHzPSYUnrA4kJFfgSrL2JS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdpUFhJwjvLRtRptjLoz6aUJovxowoyZzHKhC5Le5m1ZL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVx93KK2kDvBP6wz2D5hsk3kHzPSYUnrA4kJFfgSrL2JS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e39zKaBvT2c5k7MtHqM5RVBdj5RZFZ1Gg"], "tags": ["photograph", "photography", "digital", "blackandwhite", "arkansas"], "extra": {}}

I can remember how happy I was at the time as I edited this photo. It was the first time in a long time that I was actually proud of myself.\nI was never really good at anything in life and that usually brought me down but that is where photography helped turn that around for me. To see something beautiful in nature from a unique perspective and to be able to turn that into a frozen moment to share with others is where I could see myself looking forward into life. \nIn other words, I'd say photography has helped give meaning to my life and has helped move me forward.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWwEYxECdw5QNBveYH9wHyCVqpLAEv8V5R5jGDu7r9stM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNT9bbRPg2LiWTTbQfaoV823PoRXooh5yom6gBit9GdNR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWwEYxECdw5QNBveYH9wHyCVqpLAEv8V5R5jGDu7r9stM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e39zKaBvT2c5k7MtHqM5RVBdj5RZFZ1Gg"], "tags": ["nature", "photography", "photograph", "blackandwhite", "digital", ""], "extra": {}}

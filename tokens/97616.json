Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture\u2014known as bycatch\u2014in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites; it alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings. Nearly all species of sea turtle are now classified as endangered, with three of the seven existing species being critically endangered.\" - WWF", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTJUuYUjjFrPsSTiLc41QqfJjmKfygBDD29LixTzsxNag", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbhxjqEQBKLRQAnarfRUxRecUxC98oXTtG2jeJ78j9rmm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1djY6f8CkKXsbjGw4pBvKBr4r3RsSuAQDj"], "tags": ["digitalart", "cleannfts", "nfts", "nft", "endangeredspecies", "seaturtles"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/png", "uri": "ipfs://QmTJUuYUjjFrPsSTiLc41QqfJjmKfygBDD29LixTzsxNag"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmP1WPbsj6nmd35xRU5XztcAvTz9jYEGkdzMoQbyC6Cuh1"}, "supply": "15", "transfered": 0}

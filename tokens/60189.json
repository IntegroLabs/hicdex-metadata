The two or three years preceding 2017 were rough and had, I felt, eroded my sense of self and public image in significant ways. It felt important for me at that time to take hold of the image of myself and to actively build it up. This portrait, in which I am renamed and inverted and adorned with protective and magical equipment is from that period of restorative work.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaA7m5StYap7GiHrnKY5WUL7s7n15z8MwWifK8GbJDTYh","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1SvUbq5n5PW1S2RdRirN3kqwgE8MGyRwQx"],"tags":["animated","gif","monochrome","blackandwhite","photography","animation","projection","rodellwarner",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmaA7m5StYap7GiHrnKY5WUL7s7n15z8MwWifK8GbJDTYh"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmVky9qg7UtBD7t5ZCzg1pvigQSn8aNZ6CSQmrWxzzbbNy"},"supply":"25","transfered":73}

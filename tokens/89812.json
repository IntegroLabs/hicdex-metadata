I am also delighted by talented wordsmiths that are able to describe my inspirations with their prose. My multi media discovery takes me on a journey of a collaboration of sorts with the past and present. Each piece starts with a photography of a beautiful creature found in nature (this collection focuses on wings). My digital enhancements acknowledge the mystery of nature and develops it further with my passion for color, abstract visuals and texture. The titles are in Latin to parallel scientific origin but are not insect names, more about the beauty of words.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR5w8g4mH4zYHuWAvjcU1Wg6mLqLxeDcZTUtSSiExfMnG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1QJ1a1duESp5t9czSLQSQjH8dcbiHweeY9"], "tags": ["nfts", "digitalart", "photography", "community", "4everKurious", "twitter-@4Kurious", "Insta-@4everKurious"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmR5w8g4mH4zYHuWAvjcU1Wg6mLqLxeDcZTUtSSiExfMnG"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmXcTGwam1NaMtpG7A1ELEejKaiNUoyFMw5eRdiLLueha8"}, "supply": "25", "transfered": 39}

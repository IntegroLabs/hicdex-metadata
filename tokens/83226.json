Worlds apart, but each beautifully paintable. \\\\// It was painted in May 2008, and exhibited at an exhibition in Johannesburg in June 2008. Each buyer will be offered a signed print, sent anywhere in the world. \\\\// This artwork is part of an edition of 10. I will mint the same number, and only sell those that haven't been sold as prints in order to uphold the original edition. The remainder will be offered to the original buyers.  \\\\// Its part of the Photo Conglomerate Paintings series made with Engine. \\\\// Engine is a generative painting system that attempts to paint real-life imagery and reveals its algorithm as it interprets its own version of reality.  This was painted with Engine V12 in May 2008 The subject, painter and software work collaboratively to create these artworks. We have painted everything from Landscapes, to Still Life's and Portraits. It has most notably been shown live at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC, and at the Whitney Museum. \\\\// More info can be found @ danielhirschmann.com","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmfDudC4NkjbGg5U2Ks9Wp81uYyAkaDPEYx8Waw8NkZgwL","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1ZLHjgRkpE2et6KPXdN5ejH8CjqEwBEz4b"],"tags":["Generative","Painting","Realtime","Processing","Edition","generativepainting","archive","2008","physical","print"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmfDudC4NkjbGg5U2Ks9Wp81uYyAkaDPEYx8Waw8NkZgwL"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://Qmd7FHoeyDVMfCUdZVBXUd6B8LC7QJxJEwwEf8BSfvyrTX"},"supply":"10","transfered":1}

The simulation operated on the servers for almost a week, generating 500 snapshots of the state of matter in a uniform universe made up of 276,498 particles. These elements represent the contribution to the formation of a velocity vector field, the final result of the study, represented by a cube of which each side is 100 million light years in length. 2160 ×2160px PNG","artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmeb1ij9UdYs8AfBKHxtNw9EP1PZc2hDXfTYifKyfP4o7o","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://Qmeb1ij9UdYs8AfBKHxtNw9EP1PZc2hDXfTYifKyfP4o7o"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmdQsQEgXV99t8gf1uAmuYCRu9QJFrzMQwrP5ya7aLxg43"},"supply":"50","transfered":62}

That's one of the most famous paintings of Salvador Dali, which marks his return to his \"paranoiac-critical method.\" In this reinterpretation, the art gains movements while the tigers now morph into pomegranates which become melting clocks later, two main elements in Dali's surrealism. I call this new computer modified art self-surrealism, as it uses self-supervised techniques in ML.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPheLXYeQYWkSZaf1HC3MGBDEErpdXG6hALzY78qG1RMg","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1TXQ9kc8RmULRWpzaomgmJEHbY1TKbC7wi"],"tags":["AI","VQVAE","CLIP","Surrealism","Dali","Pomegranate","Bee","Self-surrealism"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmPheLXYeQYWkSZaf1HC3MGBDEErpdXG6hALzY78qG1RMg"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmaikTYXrFf8rFZJSgJw14FmutHA5nfap4sVi2yHz79uAM"},"supply":"1","transfered":2}

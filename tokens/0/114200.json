The main shape symbolizes a time line made up of three materials: concrete, wood and liquid that changes from red (life) to blue (death). The organic shapes that surround it symbolize the family union. The scene is created on a small scale and shot with a 140mm macro lens to achieve a soft focus point. Made in Blender.

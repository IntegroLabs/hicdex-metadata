The photo was shot during the great migration which is an annual occurrence of one of Nature's wonders of the world.  All elephants are herd animals with a very definite social structure. It is very uncommon to see one on its own far away from the herd.  This photo was shortlisted in multiple wildlife photography contests.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRkMbvWVwqh5Wgu5xVhoMnetajK6pp7wDPSmdEcCyecjB","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1UbjEFbdzQtN3Vxc8TBdEWN3deBGa5JChU"],"tags":["AfricanElephant","WildlifePhotography","Nature","Wild","Elephant","NationalGeographic","Safari","MasaiMara","MassaiMara","GreatMigration","SaudiPhotographer","NomadicFrame","Kenya","Africa","Serengeti","GreatMigration","Lonely","Alone","Rare","AnimalSighting","NFT","NFTArt","NFTPhoto","NFTPhotography","Tusks","Ivory","Poachers","WildlifeProtection","WWF","CryptoArt","DigitalArt","ProfessionalPhotography"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmRkMbvWVwqh5Wgu5xVhoMnetajK6pp7wDPSmdEcCyecjB"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmTvRHsWC4HqL3micfcbDvXFzmrUk6tzhBp5afy4AvMuJx"},"supply":"10","transfered":45}

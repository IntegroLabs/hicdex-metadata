Still looking for a suitable place to start over. Our train \"The Last Hope\" is holding up well. Today we drove through areas that only smelled of garbage, dirt and death. A big explosion could be seen in the distance, which was stirring up Marilyn, our train pig. I will not give up hope and find a place to create new life that does not want to extinguish itself. My battery is slowly getting weak, so I will put myself in standby mode. Hopefully the next time I wake up I will be in a beautiful and peaceful world.

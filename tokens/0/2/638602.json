{"__version": 1, "token_id": 638602, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "OVER THIN KING", "description": "Raise your hand if you are an overthinker? Aren't we all? It has to be a basic human attribute for those that are conscious and have agency. The word overthinking can be broken up into 3 separate words: OVER THIN KING. What's an interesting coincidence or a chance of fate is that I personally have overly thin proportions; ectomorphic body type and I'm definitely in the category of being an overthinking person. The real question that spawns from this is: Am I the Over Thin King? Hmm...I see some eyes rolling in the background from some critics. That's ok, I'm rolling my eyes on that as well. Maybe, we're all just overthinking the meaning of OVER THIN KING? That would be quite meta, ironic, and yet apropos at the same exact time.

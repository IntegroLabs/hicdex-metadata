From 1967 - 2000 in Indonesia, it was illegal to show your Chinese associated religion, beliefs, and celebration. The reason was that the manifestation of Chinese tradition was believed to bring negative effects to Indonesian citizens' psychological, mental, and moral welfare.  People were still allowed to celebrate the Chinese traditions with their family in the house, but they had to do it in discreet. These rules made Chinese Indonesians seen as an exclusive group of people as if they did not want to blend in with the society.  The lion dance captured in this picture was my dad's second time watching it on the act. The first time he saw it was back when he was still a child around 1970. Back then, the Chinese community had to request a permit in order to perform this dance. While looking at this picture, I remember my father told me that although they could only perform a short and quiet dance, it was still such a beautiful and magnificent show.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUCDC7RmNGVoGjtrFfUcKojdrxRcfJHvL7BFva2VqbTZC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXZF4DoxN9XCPpCpNy6uq4iCgSQVAAjYEzvMy6FADnn3a", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUCDC7RmNGVoGjtrFfUcKojdrxRcfJHvL7BFva2VqbTZC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RRz3fYAnpMSD2mmjEWiKHCNG3r7TVpE3B"], "tags": ["history", "photography", "liondance", "indonesia", "chineseindonesia", "chindo", "barongsai", "chinesenewyear", "CNY"], "extra": {}}

The idea of natural and technological growth is contrasted through the juxtaposition of this technology with images of natural forms. Earth's deep time, which has evolved such mineral specimens over millions of years is contrasted with the technological time of the algorithmic imagination that can produce endless possibilities from its latent distribution. space.   As machine learning is increasingly used within the scientific domain to find patterns in extremely large datasets as well as augment existing data, the work seeks to explore the consequences of this for the future of knowledge and our ways of knowing and representing the expanses of the cosmos.    A Deep Convolutional General Adversarial Network (DCGAN) is a class of artificial intelligence algorithm  used in unsupervised machine learning to produce photo-realistic images.

Anyone can draw, set, or replace a pixel on this canvas by: minting an Objkt with a properly formatted title, example: x12y24#FF0000 and sending it to this address : tz1QLqKRozFS4xKTjmeqQ5LPp7pzmoKJ8AmP // The project will last at least 100 days. At its end, the canvas will freeze at its latest version. Hopefully a collaborative final drawing made by multiple participants will exist at that time. // by @branksypop ","tags":["pixelnunc","pixelart","pixel","canvas","svg","pixel-canvas","collaborative","interactive","api"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/svg+xml","uri":"ipfs://QmUcggHRp31nPTFTEopigsGuu8Zc77V7iTVK9ei57jmGJk"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUcggHRp31nPTFTEopigsGuu8Zc77V7iTVK9ei57jmGJk","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbsFfXb8xg1imM81FUvdXbj3PbUm1gGT8uP4keWrGQ71t","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

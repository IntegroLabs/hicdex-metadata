Many children have imaginary friends, but when that imaginary friend doesn't go away as the child gets older, perhaps you should start to worry.  In this scene, a pale young woman, teddy bear in hand, stands in her nightgown in front of a dark forest.  A short, creepy monster with buggy eyes stands next to her with one arm wrapped around the girl and the other pointing at you, the viewer.  A white cat with grey spots peeks out from behind the girl.  Somewhat inspired by  Grant Wood's \"American Gothic\"","tags":["horror","monster","beast","nightmare","scary","fiendish","halloween","terror","creepy","fiend","fiendish","sleestak","gothic","taboo","imaginaryfriend","gothichorror"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmSqnqTStDT9h7dnwq5n5WnF8ub6SYgcsp4AWYVy1wADt8","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSqnqTStDT9h7dnwq5n5WnF8ub6SYgcsp4AWYVy1wADt8","display_uri":"ipfs://QmapuRzctdgKDCuMTit9Ehv5vSNNqnCJs2MSsmButqrRik","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

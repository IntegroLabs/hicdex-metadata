This man has promised to send postcards from every corner of the world wherever he goes, and even to send postcards from the end of the world.\nSome postcards will have many editions and some will be very scarce, but all together they will tell the life of this traveler, who has left his home in search of certain death, in a strange place, in a foreign bed, far from everything and his loneliness.\nPostcard #1: Cusco in Peru, the starting point. We still don't even know the name of the traveler, but we do know that he has just embarked on a great journey far away from everything, from a small town in the Peruvian Andes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTpuVDbkkEvXwQcAGBzV7HkNLyY95U2h9K7KPSZL6Wqyp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRvs2fq1fiJnV5eFkqboVFE9AfUxndsFFWfJ6ZoA3q2eS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTpuVDbkkEvXwQcAGBzV7HkNLyY95U2h9K7KPSZL6Wqyp", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Lp4f1RoBQGxWfyhH9hDfijm6PorKUpsfq"], "tags": ["Postcardsfromtheendoftheworld", "Postcards", "Cusco", "Peru", ""], "extra": {}}

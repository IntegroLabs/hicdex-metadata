Before the universe was, I am. I made the suns. I made the worlds. I created the lives and the places they inhabit; I move them here, I put them there. They go as I say, they do as I tell them. I am the word and my name is never spoken, the name which no one knows. I am called Ubik, but that is not my name. I am. I shall always be. // A collab between @matheussiq8 and @iglegabriel. // 1024 x 1024 px // Collectors can get in touch for a Prores 422 HQ file.","tags":["ubik","Ubik","UBIK","video","macro","digital","BlackandWhite","Monochrome","Music","NFT","ART","soundtrack","GabrielIglesias","MatheusSiqueira","White","Black"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmVpU9QYPssTixm4Ld5AGyLEvuw2azC6LHHYzN6HKjXMDX"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVpU9QYPssTixm4Ld5AGyLEvuw2azC6LHHYzN6HKjXMDX","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

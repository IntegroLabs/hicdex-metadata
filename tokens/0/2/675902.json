Inspired by my friend, Tyler Brown, his is my first-ever clay sculpted NFT. He stands watchful, and ever vigilant in the fight against ignorance and the myriad outdated and corrupt dogmas that hinder us all. There is only one path to take, and that is the path forward. There is no going back. You can never go home. Onwards. Onwards until we arrive at the place we all know is there and waiting for us.

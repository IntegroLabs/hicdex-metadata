Depending on the species of the jellyfish and the depth at which it is found, the message is different. It is, in a way, a marine signpost of our current civilization.\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVzrCkVZPpk4Y25xcXgbKG4hTwzy58h95fymbZoHcSWaM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSF9h8PpzQqDmUhyhmidYgp2rNR2Gqx5Vfkhs8rMryMky", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVzrCkVZPpk4Y25xcXgbKG4hTwzy58h95fymbZoHcSWaM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld", "jellyfish", "pink"], "extra": {}}

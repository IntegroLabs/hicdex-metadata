But how does it really feel when you take LSDs or magic mushrooms? Most of my creative friends said that it feels like everything is moving and everything is colorful. Some guys said they can see someone they haven't met yet but it feels like it's their alter-ego or past life.\n\nIn this WFH Collection #6, this is what I feel when I am madly deeply in-zone with my artworks and masterpiece creation. It feels like going inside a different world to me. I feel high when I am making my own artworks and it feels like I'm talking to them. I really put a lot of thought and emotions in making this project.

Some see nothing more than life and death. They are dead, for they have no dreams.","tags":["berserk","fanart","darkarts","digitalsculpting","zbrush","substancepainter","unrealengine"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmSTnCcVFoHjBr3fbR1FjCoK8C8Ee4dnK2rx78E49pnxFF"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSTnCcVFoHjBr3fbR1FjCoK8C8Ee4dnK2rx78E49pnxFF","display_uri":"ipfs://QmYqjgksgaj56SKTARZaQK5abC4F5Z4zG9K9gSDd4EQEGG","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

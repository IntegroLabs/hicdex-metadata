Dreams breathe life into men and can cage them in suffering. Men live and die by their dreams. But long after they have been abandoned they still smolder deep in men's hearts. Some see nothing more than life and death. They are dead, for they have no dreams.","tags":["berserk","fanart","darkarts","digitalsculpting","zbrush","substancepainter","unrealengine"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmSTnCcVFoHjBr3fbR1FjCoK8C8Ee4dnK2rx78E49pnxFF"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSTnCcVFoHjBr3fbR1FjCoK8C8Ee4dnK2rx78E49pnxFF","display_uri":"ipfs://QmYqjgksgaj56SKTARZaQK5abC4F5Z4zG9K9gSDd4EQEGG","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

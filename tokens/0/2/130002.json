{"__version": 1, "token_id": 130002, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Cheesecake", "description": "Instructions Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9\", and whose height is at least 1 1/4\". Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.  To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.  Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.  To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature. Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the oven, and also protects the bottom of the crust from any potential scorching. Pour the filling into the crust.  To bake the cheesecake: Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield; or shield the crust with strips of aluminum foil. Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes). A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1\" from the edge should read between 165\u00b0F and 170\u00b0F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center.  Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a rack to cool. Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it, covered, until you're ready to serve it.  Serve cheesecake in wedges, with fresh fruit if desired.

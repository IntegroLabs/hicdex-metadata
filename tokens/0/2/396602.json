Possibly a word, phrase, verse, or sentence that reads the same backward or forward? A words or phrases like noon, mom, dad, race car, etc perhaps? Yes to all of that, but I'm going to illustrate a different type of palindrome. This one the second half of the sentence isn't written backwards, but the placement of the words mirrors that of the subject of that same sentence. The hell does that mean Andrew? Ok, let's take a closer look at this sentence. WE ARE ALONE; TOGETHER & TOGETHER; ALONE ARE WE. We can immediately see that the \"&\" is in the very middle of the sentence. This visual aid to helps see how the sentence breaks in half. To translate the sentence, WE ARE (individually) ALONE; (collectively) TOGETHER & TOGETHER (individually as a species); (and collectively) ALONE ARE WE. So we are starting from the individual of our species to the collective as a species to the individual species to the collective individuals of that species.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTFYQC5qo5y2xFP1yG4dJnAiXYHhzqaTquTR7kC4N6YM6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTqbBiJxKNbULxVTmfjLJ6m3ntYdL6pbzShVpVbcL1yUh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTFYQC5qo5y2xFP1yG4dJnAiXYHhzqaTquTR7kC4N6YM6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

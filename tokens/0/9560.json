Bitelement Xingchang is a site specific geolocation based artwork that invites visitors to explore the old town of Xinchang. People took a map and a pair of Google cardboard VR goggles then explored the town. The visitor is invited to discover hidden QR codes marked by neon signs scattered around the town. This 19 second video was created from the earth element of the installation.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmX7SBAoZy3jbGpEA19ZszamJcndTUWDxAzCxc1iLHjrFE","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"video/quicktime","uri":"ipfs://QmX7SBAoZy3jbGpEA19ZszamJcndTUWDxAzCxc1iLHjrFE"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmScGAsHFzPbPhM7mfsWcLDf9iY1LGKwJYeXZeutkZAz7F"},"supply":"4","transfered":2}

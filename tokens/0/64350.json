The glows from the mysterious crystals showing where to go further to these mysterious wanderers to reach their cherished goal.Â Each of us is a shadow in search of his truth and the purple glow from the mysterious crystals will show us the way. But only our faith in ourselves keeps us from fading, from going astray and staying in this cave forever, never finding our way to the light.

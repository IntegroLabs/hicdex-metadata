I did a live coding session on my fav software touchdesigner, starting with an empty project. Then I create a feedback loop, it means that all the effects are applied again and again in a loop. Only some precise moments of the input video get in the loop, then the effect extend very fast, due to the fact it's applying it's operations on itself. Hmmm I hope this is understandable... I feel a bit alone with this kind of effects. I love create feedback loops, and add more and more operations into it, and see what happens, some time I lost the image, everything goes black. Other time everything goes white, can be ugly, and 2 min later mind-blowing visuals, idk. I try to surf on this effects and create performances of it. Me live coding.\n\nIf u're curious, follow my Twitch channel, I'll do it again, and again, and again. Until I'll be able to create dope dope visuals very very fast. I want to be the best.\n\nStill in this series, there are some Ambers I don't like much. But I recorded it so, let's put it on the blockchain, I want to show the evolution of my art.\n\nI hope you'll like it, and the ones I find bad, I will put it at discount prices.\n\nThanks. \"\n\n\u22f1\u22f1\u22f1\u22f0\u22ef\u22ef \u22f1\u22f1\u22f1\u22f0-*--\u2056\u205d:\u2026\u2053~-\u22f0~\u203e\u00af\u203e\u22f1\u22f1\u22f1\u22f0\u22ef\u22ef\u22f0\u22ef\u22ef\u22f0\u22ef\u22f1\u22f1\u22ef\u22f1\u22f1\u22f0\u2af6\u2af6\u2056\u2056\u205d:\u2026\u2053~\u203e\u00af\u203e\u00af\u205c\u2017\u266a\u22f1\u22f1\nA \uff4d \uff42\uff45\uff52\uff53\u2591\uff4f\uff46\u2591\uff54\uff48\uff45\u2591\uff32\uff45\uff41\uff4c\uff54\uff49\uff4d\uff45 \u301081-101\u3011 Le \u2020r\u00f0\u00ef\u00a7\u00ef\u00e8me R\u00eave\n\nImages of Samurai Jack and One Piece melted in my third Dream.\n\u22ef\u22ef zzzZZZ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXUaZeNgZAXWrKaGkadMFMwcjfMjf3UYSoztUo3vV91Cb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQbAWPzbJ39DZmhfsxZyHf1gMyohYmQ6e6qUxJ5rvtE1B", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXUaZeNgZAXWrKaGkadMFMwcjfMjf3UYSoztUo3vV91Cb", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QFyjHEp3kfeyEuMAAcuc4oYZjmrMjn9vx"], "tags": ["Generativeart", "OnePiece", "SamuraiJack", "Realtime", "Aotr", "Ambersoftherealtime", "Touchdesigner", "feedback", "art", "glitchart", "newmediaart", "reuse", "f_lse_no", "realtimemotiongraphics", "VJART", "VJ"], "extra": {}}

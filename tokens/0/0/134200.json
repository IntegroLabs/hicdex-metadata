The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","tags":["Cyclic","cellular","automata","33","gif","wolfram"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://Qmf3UnbGyUVHhvEEmGs5xQbP1x2fLyULoMLW252ydoX3fS","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmf3UnbGyUVHhvEEmGs5xQbP1x2fLyULoMLW252ydoX3fS","display_uri":"ipfs://Qmf3UnbGyUVHhvEEmGs5xQbP1x2fLyULoMLW252ydoX3fS","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 675800, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "THE OTHER MOTHER; HER, ANOTHER MOM.", "description": "From the image you see on the other page, we can create the title of this work simply by adding a couple \"M\"s above and below the word ANOTHER. In doing so, this gives us agency to create a list of words that were previously out of our purview. Also, we can change the colors of some of the letters so that it's easier to see the hidden words revealed. Letters and words in specific contexts can create a number of interesting variable permutation possibilities. Just by proximity we can create the words: HER / OTHER / MOTHER / MOM / THE / ANOTHER. From this list of new found words, we can think and create a narrative that in a conversation could be used as a way to delineate between a space where there are multiple mothers and their children. In this particular work, we can say, \"THE OTHER MOTHER (over there); HER (a specific woman), ANOTHER MOM (slightly superfluous as we've already established that this particular other woman is a mother, but less formal in it's presentation by using the word MOM. All of this looks and sounds ridiculous...and that's the point, but there's real logic behind it all.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNcPtYSQ4ZryNPq71e99az1Hmv4FVARJQRjRcAQJy141Q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmduQK7FgGeRBuwZAoXNLhAeybEUmnKPeKKYBo9JVj4q8N", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNcPtYSQ4ZryNPq71e99az1Hmv4FVARJQRjRcAQJy141Q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

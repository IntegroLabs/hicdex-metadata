I wanted to experiment to see if I can connect words of different lengths. The result is the image you see. The English language has many, many little loopholes, exceptions, oddities, etc, but the principal similarities between all 7 of these words are the letters \"A\" and \"N\" or the word \"AN\". Locating and finding various words of different lengths and then placing them in a specific order is not the easiest of tasks, but one that I find a small amount of joy in. I'm sure if I had a therapist, they would say that I have control issues in my life, to which I would say...who doesn't at this point given the scope and scale of the pandemic. We all lost something or someone or some part of ourselves this past year and a half. We all have wildly different coping mechanisms in our lives: some people eat, some people withhold from eating. Some people buy a fast sportscar, some people sell everything they own. Some people find God, some people lose their faith. Some people write and create, some people try to take the freedoms of others away. Some people escape in the use of chemicals, some people sober up. The list goes on and on, but something that we all have in common is that we are all going through this separately together and together separately. This artwork is an ode to our innate human capacity for shared experiences and our resiliency in the face of extreme adversity. The contrasts between us can either make us stronger and imbue growth or cause humanity to act selfishly like crabs in a bucket and devolve into chaos and disorder.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb95tPy5HKwXgGKv9vEc6sy41NCMzzaf5xq9LvFdPd6w7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVbmLanBn7QbH5xcEHpkkfcMrRNyPmWePNpaGh8PR1zJe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb95tPy5HKwXgGKv9vEc6sy41NCMzzaf5xq9LvFdPd6w7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

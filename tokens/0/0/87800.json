This leaves us unable to see another way, move, or change.When you’re stuck, surrender to being stuck.  I notice the thoughts and feelings within me that say that I’m stuck, and that something is wrong.  If I stay completely in this moment, there is no being stuck. There is only the label of a situation—a label that I’ve invented based on what I think my life should look like.

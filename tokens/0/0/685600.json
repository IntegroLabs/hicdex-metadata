The term has also been used interchangeably with a 'good person' (Ancient Greek: \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2, agathos), and a 'virtuous person' (Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2, spoudaios). Among the earliest accounts of the sage begin with Empedocles' Sphairos. \n\nHorace describes the Sphairos as \"Completely within itself, well-rounded and spherical, so that nothing extraneous can adhere to it, because of its smooth and polished surface.\" Alternatively, the sage is one who lives \"according to an ideal which transcends the everyday.\"\n\nSeveral of the schools of Hellenistic philosophy have the sage as a featured figure. Karl Ludwig Michelet wrote that \"Greek religion culminated with its true god, the sage\".\n\nPierre Hadot develops this idea, stating that \"the moment philosophers achieve a rational conception of God based on the model of the sage, Greece surpasses its mythical representation of its gods.\"Indeed, the actions of the sage are propounded to be how a god would act in the same situation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTu4AB3nxS3CbtVGTCkxJ5NXqbuHar97z95gDihScHuU3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTu4AB3nxS3CbtVGTCkxJ5NXqbuHar97z95gDihScHuU3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTu4AB3nxS3CbtVGTCkxJ5NXqbuHar97z95gDihScHuU3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dWC1aKp8vfiFBAC7tZSigyTiumVrWFcwM"], "tags": ["Sage", "wisdom", "philosophy", "digitalart", "digital", "illustration", "minimalart", "abstract", "sureal", "time", "illusion"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 639800, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SEXIST EXISTS", "description": "I had this idea for a sculpture awhile back where I took a 'Newton's Cradle' device and painted on the letters of word SEXISTS one-by-one onto each of the metallic balls. The last decade or so I've been thinking about my place in the human hierarchy of sex and the comparisons between the male and female of our species. What I've discovered (and this is going to sound really bad for one side) is that women are amazing and lots of men are extremely problematic. Women can literally do anything a man can and get this guys...they can do stuff better than you. Gasp...the horror. For years when I would read about the Harvey Weinstein's, the Kevin Spacey's, the R. Kelly's of the world and wonder WTF is wrong with these men? The answer usually comes back to Lord Acton's famous words, \"All power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" Doesn't matter if they're straight white men, gay men or African-American men, absolute power, corrupts absolutely. This is not to say that before these men had power, they weren't good people to begin with, but there is something about the dynamic of power that shifts a person's perspective and dominates their personality. SEXIST EXISTS is a work that boldly states and acknowledges the truth of where we are as a species. Men might want to take a sobering look at themselves and say what have I done today to help women be equal. Or at maybe ask the questions, \"Am I a good man to other men and towards women?\" or \"How or what can I do I change the current paradigm?\" or \"How do I change to be more compassionate?\" It starts with one person; are you that one person?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPSRXUX2orFcvv4BJFvjErFebn8JDWXNr9CP5R9EoRWLh", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf9Lb9JBdrHHmjGh5j9n8GpEm86dKRXpoiY9mP7NSiaev", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPSRXUX2orFcvv4BJFvjErFebn8JDWXNr9CP5R9EoRWLh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

I even live-streamed it on Twitch. It took several hours because I also enjoyed talking to my viewers at the same time.\n\nTwo buns you see are actually tiny creatures called sea slugs or nudibranchs. Some people call them sea bunnies as well. I really love how they look.\n\nHope you enjoy seeing them too.\n\nWith love \u2661,\n\nObchoey", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRwhD5P45tBjPesebc9e6yUMG6VHBmtJt33NXkQJVDuXK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXNRJLjMzmRCACc8mT7oTENwXxtpMZgmHZLvswrorwDW4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRwhD5P45tBjPesebc9e6yUMG6VHBmtJt33NXkQJVDuXK", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1RoRPs7eNvQDSVQQfgPTrSDUBka8kj2fkN"], "tags": ["digital", "illustration", "wacom", "cintiq", "clipstudiopaint", "dimsum", "seaslugs", "nudibranch", "bunnies", "rabbits", "creatures", "chinesefood", "obchoey", "peachdotgif"], "extra": {}}

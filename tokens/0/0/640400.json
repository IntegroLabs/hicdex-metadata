When the tirta amerta had reached his throat, Lord Vishnu released his arrow which caused Kala Rau's head to cut off and then floated in the sky. The remaining pieces of the headless body fell to Earth, and became dimples.\n\nKala Rau, who has always been in love with Dewi Ratih (Goddess of the Moon) and is always looking for her. At one time when the goddess was walking in the sky, Kala Rau tried to hold her by swallowing her. However, because Kala Rau was only a head, Dewi Ratih immediately escaped from his embrace.\n\n===\n\nRakaJana\n2022", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPFcSC1oJJDUtzer6EroPK3nBnYzLzXcmBD24TWcW2rws", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRhiVMWZcpvBRPKQy3T5pmRDeJqhMNMTpSJEmyigpdntE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPFcSC1oJJDUtzer6EroPK3nBnYzLzXcmBD24TWcW2rws", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WyqapuXM2ieFydW1Q6g7DXPnbwAfZbw8D"], "tags": ["bali", "folklore", "illustration", "rakajana"], "extra": {}}

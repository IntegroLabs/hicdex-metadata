{"__version": 1, "token_id": 682000, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LULO", "description": "\nMonday I found a dog left abandoned on the streets, tied with industrial chains. I picked him up and took him to my place. He walked with me scared and entered to my home. At the first sign I couldn\u2019t tell in which conditions he was left and also the emotional impact of a dog who was surely abused before. Although he felt safe, the emotional consequences of an unknown past to me are evident but he\u2019s been brave at the same time the past days. His hair hide the malnutrition state to the eyes and I will have to wait still he calms down a bit to take him to the vet and start the treatment. I made this artwork in representation of him and the fruit he is name after: Lulo, a Colombian exotic fruit. To cover the upcoming vet bills and recovery. Thanks In advance with the community for the support.

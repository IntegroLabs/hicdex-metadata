It requires little more than the most infinitesimal of fluctuations, within that dark frame, to initiate this rainbow blaze.\n\nGazing into Nature, we see these same processes occur; it is unfolding right now within you, as you read these words; as your cells divide and replicate themselves, as your lungs draw oxygen into your bloodstream, and release dissolved gasses for your to exhale.\n\nIt is why anything at all - everything - exists.\n\nIn the same way, a microphone connected to an amplified speaker quickly results in a white hot pinpoint of sound saturating the air. Sing into a room at its resonant harmonics and its walls begin to sing with you.\n\nLife is not a bit different from this.\n\nWhen you become that grain of fluctuation in the dark; very quickly it is dark no longer. \n\nAn eternal morning arises.\n\nProcess: A Sony KV-13FM12, Sony HVC-2400, Sony XV-5000, Panasonic WJ-MX50A, Panasonic WJ-MX30 and Videonics MX-1 dreaming of each other, through each other.

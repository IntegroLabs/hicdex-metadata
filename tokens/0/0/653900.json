All people from any part of the world, connected through the NFT world, echo these words like a mantra that keeps repeating to get their luck.\nSometime later, we realized that GM stands for \u201cGood Morn- ing.\u201d We don\u2019t know where the trend is coming from, it could be that we just wanted to make things feel more concise, or it was a ploy to have fewer characters typed. But we know these abbreviations, mostly interpreted positively by people.\nPerhaps, it has developed into a mandatory culture for people swimming in the NFT world.\nWe try to respond to this by creating a collective work contain- ing several photo stories and packaging into a digital zine, re- leased into two volumes.\nLet\u2019s dive into the sea of meanings about GM itself from vari- ous perspectives, mindsets, and creative freedom. Enjoy!\n\nThe Artists:\n@yugaknow\n@arifshrn\n@fan_fin\n@radhyaaja2\n@ggepe\n@dinprasetyo_id\n@algifs\n&\n@agareds as editor\n\n\u00a92022. GM!

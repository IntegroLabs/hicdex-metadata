As a Nordic emblem, comes the idea behind 'House of Freyja'. This work is an offering to the goddess Freyja, as she is one of the most prominent deities of magic, love, beauty and fertility. I'd like to share my creation with anyone who considers it deserving of their possession, and who would like to welcome Freyja through this work to grace their lives with gratitude \u2764\ufe0f ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd1Ewy1FRikKnRuhtwCYq4of7NzAyKRFS4ow7YRpK7uwm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfSHsEwyaJgmc2FC2gEhBRFdSd6y6DHGUPRe5tJzCUNod", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd1Ewy1FRikKnRuhtwCYq4of7NzAyKRFS4ow7YRpK7uwm", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SGH1hBpKC6wWrGi8wZedyGesfzbpPYFN7"], "tags": ["NFT", "NFTCollectors", "MovingImage", "Databending", "Mediaart", "Newmedia", "Photography", "Lighting", "Techno", "VisualArt", "VideoArt", "SoundDesign", "Freyja", "NordicGod"], "extra": {}}

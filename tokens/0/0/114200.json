The main shape symbolizes a time line made up of three materials: concrete, wood and liquid that changes from red (life) to blue (death). The organic shapes that surround it symbolize the family union. The scene is created on a small scale and shot with a 140mm macro lens to achieve a soft focus point. Made in Blender. Edited in Photoshop.","tags":["3D","photoreal","illustration","3dart"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmeLM6iaXGYBXSxp6wGjFVv1TqMscvG8kv91DXDHpHHFSS"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmeLM6iaXGYBXSxp6wGjFVv1TqMscvG8kv91DXDHpHHFSS","display_uri":"ipfs://QmUWNnQPo9pq3gGEqPjtverpNSwZa9W8BGxQLZAEgkoLjb","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

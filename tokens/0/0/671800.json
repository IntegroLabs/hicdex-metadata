{"__version": 1, "token_id": 671800, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Behind The Safehouse", "description": "On March 18, 1990, thirteen works of art were stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. The guards on duty allowed two men posing as police officers to enter the museum. The rest, as they say, is history. \n\nIn this piece the HEU has attempted to make every collector and art lover\u2019s dream come true, by allowing them to find the most valuable art ever stollen. \n\nThis room, created by Laureano & Everlastingbuilding, holds the most significant pieces stollen.  \n\nJohannes Vermeer\u2019s The concert - One of only thirty-four paintings attributed to Vermeer.\n\nRembrandt\u2019s The Storm on the Sea of Galilee - The only known Seascape by Rembrandt.\n\nRembrandt\u2019s A Lady and Gentleman in Black - Considered one of the artist's finest works. \n\n\u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Chez Tortoni - A smaller though universally cherished work.\n\nSadly, no arrests have been made and none of the art stolen has been recovered. However until then, may this interactive work bring us closer to what that moment the works are recovered may look like.

My 6 yo son, Totoy, never like to draw. He usually say \"i can't draw, your drawing is better than mine\". but i told him atleast to try it first and then finish what he has started. it's ok if it isn't perfect. but one day i took his drawing and combine with mine. I show him and he is so happy. Then i let him draw in some part of the work. He quite enjoy it. I hope this artwork will reminds him to be brave to try everything first before he decided whether he like it or not. And not to forget to enjoy every process of everything he'll do in the future. Last bu not least, we hope you like it!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNiNqB5i79nbEdGLj8EhGCKgmHD8sNxtfGNgD6rSwWbdo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPnFZWTtkGE2efQoUy2cBCzXbwcBdocYoajJosaGS8koj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNiNqB5i79nbEdGLj8EhGCKgmHD8sNxtfGNgD6rSwWbdo", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2TAjdxH6nLpCShYEx34kurSXNQa2buaYA5"], "tags": ["cidman", "kids", "doodle", "illustration", "woman", "pattern"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 670800, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Zeus (Jupiter)", "description": "Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythology and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as Jupiter, Perk\u016bnas, Perun, Indra, and Dyaus.\n\nZeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born.Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many divine and heroic offspring, including Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Minos, and the Muses.[9]\n\nHe was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned roles to the others: \"Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence.\" He was equated with many foreign weather gods, permitting Pausanias to observe \"That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men\". Zeus' symbols are the thunderbolt, eagle, bull, and oak. In addition to his Indo-European inheritance, the classical \"cloud-gatherer\"  also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient Near East, such as the scepter. Zeus is frequently depicted by Greek artists in one of three poses: standing, striding forward with a thunderbolt leveled in his raised right hand, or seated in majesty.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcobcccJA55TEC5N7UR3wHK5KRZToAtmNYMBAgtVzAb3Q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcERGwn1iqpHVkYZivVuK18mYsf6SsyxrVrCAymomVu1K", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcobcccJA55TEC5N7UR3wHK5KRZToAtmNYMBAgtVzAb3Q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SwFwV4iAus6m6j2NN1v1mrUuZFvreVCpZ"], "tags": ["zeus", "statue", "antalya", "turkey", "photography", "photo", "ancient", "city", "old", "rome", "history", "mythology", "prophetic", "strong", "god", "lightning", "sky"], "extra": {}}

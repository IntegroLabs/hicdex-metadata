I\u2019m creating this Newsletter to showcase talented artists and their NFT creations. The Digital Art world is just starting and the future is very exciting. Nevertheless, there is a lot of noise that makes it hard to discover the hidden diamonds in the metaverse. My goal is to dig deeper into the history, techniques, tools, and motivation behind this new wave of creations.  Hopefully, this will help artists to promote their work, tell their full stories, and reach a broader audience.  I\u2019m passionate about Hispanic artists, generative AI, and minimalistic designs. From time to time, I might drop my own creations.  Let me know if you have some nice art to be showcased or just to say hi!

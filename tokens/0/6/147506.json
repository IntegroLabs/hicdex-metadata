So I carried this very heavy stone to it and placed it on top of it. It created a rather philosophical image of the water trying to overwin and take the chair while the weight keeps it strong in it's position. At the same time the stone seems like a heavy cloud. Part of my TenDaily project, each day a 10/10 image for Free, remainings will be burned the next day.

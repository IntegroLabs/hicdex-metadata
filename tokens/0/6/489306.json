It was shot by me in Jo\u00e3o Pessoa-Brazil in 2015 at a queer party called Kika. This party no longer exists and for this reason this is what I am calling an \"archive and feelings\". I will develop this concept better in my nexts series.\n\nlisten to Linda's DJ sets and mixtapes here: https://www.mixcloud.com/lindademorrir/\n\n\n25% of sales will be passed on to her.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXRvkgdy9oxqdsVAcPRPHJ2bUWyNZwAYvRG4Rb4U9H5rc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXRvkgdy9oxqdsVAcPRPHJ2bUWyNZwAYvRG4Rb4U9H5rc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXRvkgdy9oxqdsVAcPRPHJ2bUWyNZwAYvRG4Rb4U9H5rc", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1d2dxDa1pyQ7ivxfKpbGNyJxePY3pGN1XC"], "tags": ["glitch", "glitchart", "queer", "videoart"], "extra": {}}

I reworked a previous piece for this. My sister Angela passed away in 2007, she's been heavy on my mind lately. I have a tattoo in her hand writing on my arm to see every day that says \"I love you and I'm so proud of you\" and I take that to heart. She was my biggest fan and cheerleader. Even as early as 4th grade she was bragging to her friends about me and stole my sketch book and gave the drawings away to her friends in school. I needed to make this tribute.","tags":["portrait","abstract","strange","imissyou","loveyou"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmdhG3hWs65V16S6pZZdxr3ycg6TvKcazeJosyX7jRiYYo"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdhG3hWs65V16S6pZZdxr3ycg6TvKcazeJosyX7jRiYYo","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

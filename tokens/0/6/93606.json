Then came life. Life decided otherwise. Now I have to release these without animations. Last fall I was an entrepreneur, thing were better and had some money to pay my bills. Then I had to stop being an entrepreneur. I have some mental issues (unstable personality, ADHD) that drove me to financial problems, unpaid taxes from being entrepreneur etc..  Then came this spring. And depression. Had to stop working, go for a sick leave to get my head straight. Now I'm in a situation that my sick leave income can't provide for me and my family and kids. Barely getting rent paid. And don't have any energy to do anything about my financial problems.  This is a call for help. Please buy these Good Will Niftys and support me and my family. But don't worry, we will manage without help, just trying anything to survive.  Much love anyways <3","tags":["donation","charity","goodwill","pleasehelp","vector","royalniftys"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmWZg5tjWnNYwJweNxUVWPxDG3Npr59LqdAfv3rp59D5gf"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWZg5tjWnNYwJweNxUVWPxDG3Npr59LqdAfv3rp59D5gf","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

At each event that marks us, in some way, a new cycle is created. A new \"self\" is remade. Always dissolving in the emptiness of our existence and reinventing itself in it.

And art provides us, at least, to find beautiful in something that hurts us so much.","tags":[],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmdMZZshGpg7hqqSBGgwwv2Xv9nAdSEdzqttS6w8nyvZqU"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdMZZshGpg7hqqSBGgwwv2Xv9nAdSEdzqttS6w8nyvZqU","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbQjjvGkKsdgGyu61BKg6ZwrfbpRYLuikk8GJ8pF6hSZh","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

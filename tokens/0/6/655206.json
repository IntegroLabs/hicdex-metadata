Occam's Razor roughly says that the most simple explanation is most likely the correct one. When it comes to the existence of extra terrestrial life and more specifically crop circles... I'm not sure I want the truth to be that it was a bunch of bored farmers. It's much more exciting to think they were created by alien life and that there is much more to our universe than we know. Examples of crop circles have been appearing since the 1980s BUT the far more impressive and grandiose Nazca lines have existed as far back as 500 BC and those creations are much harder to fathom being created by man. Some of them measure up to 400 yards long and are so accurately rendered they had to have been made by some higher power. I say I would want to meet these beings, BUT... there is far more dramatized fiction about aliens abducting humans and doing terrible experiments on them in which case I think earth is gonna need a better scarecrow.

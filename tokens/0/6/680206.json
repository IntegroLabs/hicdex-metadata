{"__version": 1, "token_id": 680206, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Dirge for Edith's Perfection #12", "description": "\nOn February 11th 1935, Edith Peshak's cancer ridden corpse was given over to the Invisible Helpers, for the perfection of her soul. Washing of the body, the cold, dry climate, and the milk and egg enemas sustaining her vessel ultimately led to mummification. Her son alerted authorities, and eventually the followers of The Home of Truth moved on from necroaspiria to cremation. Edith's ashes were hidden in the canyonlands. Eventually a marker was placed in Idaho alongside her dear husband Elmer's final resting place. Marie Ogden's cult faded into history.\n\nPainting the site of Edith's perfection with music indexing the inevitable slide from spiritualism into delusion, fascist affiliations, and lost hope for a new age as promised by a charismatic leader, these NFTs were recorded on location from the air waves, February 2022. The music is for the location, at the location. One hour and twenty one minutes in duration, generative music, each performance is a unique 1/1, in space and time.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HLvH7pUaxLo\n\nminted specially for atezorless", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmazDYznTTfAoL8rc7ZPSryy5BREXYE26qXtb92RYbSU9p", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNUaYeUjex5QmqQcGKPGg3G194goCnjzvWLz7iSMsmanv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmazDYznTTfAoL8rc7ZPSryy5BREXYE26qXtb92RYbSU9p", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XLAAbQLzfHqmyCTwe1A7uPFBu5LAqdkfX"], "tags": ["fm", "radio", "arduino", "locative", "liturgical", "generative", "nftmusic", "necroaspiria", "cults", "necrolatry", "newagemusic", "nft", "tezos", "locative", "atezorless", "@Pummelpaffpaff"], "extra": {}}

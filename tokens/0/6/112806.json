Life is what it is, an experience of emotions of all tonalities... We are like children in a field of butterflies experiencing the sensation of catching them and stumbling when trying, crying for not achieving it, laughing for seeing the colors of all those emotions that you perceive in all possible ways, I can only tell you that in this life, at least I, hope to learn as if I will never die and to live as if I will die tomorrow... May those who lived in my time around me remember me as someone who enjoyed the fact of existing.","tags":["0xLxxl","Absurdism","Thoughts"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmTaFfgg8nMK8mnhizGnV3TUk3TWT7SJrtb2mMM6aVNmn4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTaFfgg8nMK8mnhizGnV3TUk3TWT7SJrtb2mMM6aVNmn4","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXUcHeKzzRBmJ66trWRuXy4v28CDELrcy3QaK3xAPFyfX","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

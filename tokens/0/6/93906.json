When lost in the darkness all we have to guide us is a dim light if we’re lucky. Those lights are usually your friends and family. Follow the good and ignore the dark voices, there's no possibility there. Talk to others around you, you’ll see that you’re not alone. That light is usually the end of the tunnel.

The work features a phrase in French that means \"This is not a home\", an ironic provocation on current times and invites us to think about the recent  expedition's wave to other planets, the speculation upon possible new habitats for humanity and to assess what should be the priorities in the face of the current climate emergency. It is inspired by René Magritte's famous masterpiece 'La trahison des images' (The Treachery of Images - This is Not a Pipe, 1929).","tags":["cryptoart","cryptoart","nftart","collectible","nftcollector","NFTs","NFT","nftart","tesos","3Dart","artedigital","digitalart","digitalart","poesiavisual","visualpoetry","visualpoem","concretepoem","artecontemporânea","contemporaryart","magritte","marte","mars","emergênciaclimática","climateemergency","ironia","irony"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmdEe5ky99S7ZZq1pn8dMhE7XXGhhEWRjDv1wwZPHY3j8v","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdEe5ky99S7ZZq1pn8dMhE7XXGhhEWRjDv1wwZPHY3j8v","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdEe5ky99S7ZZq1pn8dMhE7XXGhhEWRjDv1wwZPHY3j8v","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Its abilities can be very helpful but it has its limitations, it cannot grant a soul to any creature that has died. The artifact is currently guarded by \"The Soul Guardian\".", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmehUkDHeBjp5t4GYStBAoX2eu1jjtgd6eBXwXpgJ1Rnpc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmehUkDHeBjp5t4GYStBAoX2eu1jjtgd6eBXwXpgJ1Rnpc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmehUkDHeBjp5t4GYStBAoX2eu1jjtgd6eBXwXpgJ1Rnpc", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1NqoSts4fFahSTZb6nJ4x7QGGG5LyDgkSs"], "tags": ["soul", "stone", "god", "universe", "artifact", ""], "extra": {}}

We rediscover the benefits of senses and nature in a path of contact with your interiority and balance of mind and body. Here your well-being is safe.\"  At the end of the 1990s, after about a decade of massive growth, it was decreed “the end of the digital revolution”. The border between the private and public sphere was cracking: the work-time went mixing and melting with spare time, gradually disappeared. The PC [personal computer], software and hardware, as we know, created the user. The Id. Little by little, the distance between humans and machines, as happened for many of the previous technologies, decreased until it overlapped. Where this mixing persists, recreational rituals (\"pause\", \"vacation\", \"relax\", \"escape\") happen simultaneously in the digital and non-digital dimension. \"Let's Rituals\" is a spa experience developed by three movements:  a) care of soul/wireless, b) care of mind/software, c) care of the body/hardware.  An experience designed for human-digital users.","tags":["Vaporwave","Relax","Spa","Cinema4d","3D","3Dart","Column","Mythology","Pool","Rain","Software","Hardware","Wireless","Grid","Experience"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmcSdZSsDrmzsQygrH5dhRMsBKWhyXy4sppvP1p2Y3aMwk"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcSdZSsDrmzsQygrH5dhRMsBKWhyXy4sppvP1p2Y3aMwk","display_uri":"ipfs://QmX4wrYAxYF1NPNnuTrdD9JFc4rawgDf6SHEskYzGFCSjb","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

The painting is part of my painted series titled ‘Learning from Matisse’. The more I hand painted new paintings from the digital images, I would then retrain the algorithm with the new paintings and my new developing style. The digital version of the still life is beautiful to me as it inspired a painting out of thousands of images discarded/overlooked in the generation process.","tags":["stilllife","joannehastie","learningfrommatisse","floral","ai","ml","painting"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmW53DsQQ5XjsMte5GCvyTRQYL93cSmDARo4cg9Q7YBCg4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmW53DsQQ5XjsMte5GCvyTRQYL93cSmDARo4cg9Q7YBCg4","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXxofjFT1AhedM1K9SaZvcdq5t4Kt8qNwD2gETKswGVJf","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

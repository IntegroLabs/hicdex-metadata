The painting is part of my painted series titled \u2018Learning from Matisse\u2019. The more I hand painted new paintings from the digital images, I would then retrain the algorithm with the new paintings and my new developing style. The digital version of the still life is beautiful to me as it inspired a painting out of thousands of images discarded/overlooked in the generation process.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW53DsQQ5XjsMte5GCvyTRQYL93cSmDARo4cg9Q7YBCg4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXxofjFT1AhedM1K9SaZvcdq5t4Kt8qNwD2gETKswGVJf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz2WiAH61QKxzhhRHPpnoaHNhbEiYJ6eyGZb"], "tags": ["stilllife", "joannehastie", "learningfrommatisse", "floral", "ai", "ml", "painting"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmW53DsQQ5XjsMte5GCvyTRQYL93cSmDARo4cg9Q7YBCg4"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmeedWd9rD7LyDVJSxjcQHUtavm5TiciESFf9anifSZzRH"}, "supply": "10", "transfered": 0}

Yup, I sure did and get your mind out of the gutter because it's not what you think on this one. You all immediately thought it was a sexual innuendo. Well, it is and it and it isn't. It's both.

You cannot have the word HIM without those letters. So, the sentence is is technically true. IM is ALWAYS IN HIM. The use of the apostrophe in the I'M delineates the possessive of I am, thus creating the perceived sexual innuendo.

A Greek philosopher who lived in a barrel.\n\nThere is a fairly famous story that can describe the simplicity of Diogenes life. Once Alexander the Great came to Diogenes in his barrel to be offered whatever he asked to be given. Alexander offered Wealth, Power and more, but Diogenes' request was only one \"spend a little less between me and the sun\".\n\nDiogenes thought that the richest people in the world were the ones who could comfortably enjoy the least ownership, compared to people who had many things but always felt less.\n\nAnd to this day the spirit of Diogenes still lives on and triumphs against the world with its simplicity of life and extraordinary thinking.\n\nThis photo is unpossed, I accidentally found this moment in a ruined building in Cirebon, Indonesia around 2019.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZmhv4ksd8tCAda2QVCJrmihuWBeiiS8QJWfGGALgWMSs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRFaWegLVqzTAicuUuM5FuDD5XWP34GBwHcExmcTAP32i", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZmhv4ksd8tCAda2QVCJrmihuWBeiiS8QJWfGGALgWMSs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2GdJsgsbXs7MwcMNCrcNgf87Fy1NNtsVKC"], "tags": ["Photography", "streetphotography", "blackwhite", "diogenes", "philosophy", "yugaknow"], "extra": {}}

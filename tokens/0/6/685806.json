Lava may be erupted at a volcano or through a fracture in the crust, on land or undersea, usually at temperatures from 800 to 1,200 \u00b0C (1,470 to 2,190 \u00b0F). The volcanic rock resulting from subsequent cooling is also often called lava.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbidfm57HyjFwqM5RgMr31eBFh9hP7Unr7RKeoVeWzkqU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPcQ2nyWo1eZK5xJHZjb1SK8XXThnWdynR8UJt3uG1drV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbidfm57HyjFwqM5RgMr31eBFh9hP7Unr7RKeoVeWzkqU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SA8HrrqB168iK9cfUu2RGvPUCoow2DEwG"], "tags": ["Lava", "kolkodesign", "corroids", "monogods", "teiaart", "cryptoart", "teia", "3dart", "3d", "jpg"], "extra": {}}

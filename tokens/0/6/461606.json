I remember wishing i had models with me at the time so we could experiment with movement or gestures... but i was alone, also my family is one of those families that goes to sleep at 10 or so and after very early at night you dont hear a single noise in the house, so i had to be silent on whatever i chose to do too hehe so i felt maybe i could record my self but i have always been shy to be infront of the camera so i just kinda tied up a white towel to a couple of chairs and infront of it i \"acted\" only with my hands: i took what i thought was the most interesting object near me at the moment (a knife) and i started pointing at the camera with it. As if i was threatening it idk why... i even made some swings, as if i wanted it to know i was being serious. \n\ni hope i didnt cut it 2 much...", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmREUPxJLs4Dg2mCQUHwHHovtpjtvhADN6dh4ZDaHJfZ1y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXSN6AnVQu6xJvCz7o3msQ5RJMuxohLnndevnyojuPwGY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmREUPxJLs4Dg2mCQUHwHHovtpjtvhADN6dh4ZDaHJfZ1y", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hgdyB1cCRz1uLH5RNwrRcyHxxURibnG4G"], "tags": ["stage", "performer", "glitch", "objkt", "digitalart", "psychedelicart", "psychedelic", "objkt", "glitchobjkt", "acid"], "extra": {}}

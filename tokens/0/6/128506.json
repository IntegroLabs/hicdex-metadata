The owner was always wearing a red leather jacket and had a pump action beneath the counter. He had strong expertise in Spider-Man lore. GHOST was one of the places that had a profound impact on me as a kid. Little light and filled with comic books to the brim, the store felt like a place out of a dark 80s movie, a surreal little spacetime anomaly. Sadly, the store vanished as quickly as it materialized. Maybe it was nothing but a GHOST after all?‚Å† - 256 colors, 240 frames. 135p upscaled to 2160p.

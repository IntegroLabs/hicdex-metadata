Last week, DR.B made another trip to Tokyo and found it broken in an electronics antique store. Now he is trying to get it repaired, but its components are hard to find. The only thing he does now is to play the same piece of music over and over again.  He was our favorite musical robot. Maybe a Brazilian toy company still has its components.

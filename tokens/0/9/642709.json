This design has been 3D printed multiple times successfully without any removable supports at sizes between 5 and 20cm tall. In virtual reality, the structure was experienced at about 300 meters tall.\n\nThe spinning section view allows us to see the inside, and all of the occupiable moments and smaller spaces.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmULPVq7MkFHo5WWwm18pDv7hwhDgcYUYwjwNfcKWEwm7J", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSLfw3HfCTtHpsxrNW1Quwn5kTzCBThHdMk5c1uBogeBf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmULPVq7MkFHo5WWwm18pDv7hwhDgcYUYwjwNfcKWEwm7J", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MHcQdeDmuy9zc7cMZUTok5XCk8rULz7Bj"], "tags": ["3d", "animation", "virtualreality", "sculpture", "vrsculpture", "vr", "shadow", "alien", "otherworldly", "blender", "3Dprintable", "architecture"], "extra": {}}

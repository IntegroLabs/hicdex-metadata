{"__version": 1, "token_id": 680109, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "OLIVE JUICE", "description": "OLIVE JUICE is another widely known addition to this roster of reductive syntax word crystals that some or most of us have heard at some point in our youth. And just like ELEPHANT SHOE and ISLAND VIEW, the result is the same; they sound just like I LOVE YOU. I can't even begin to count the amount of times I saw mouths moving and thought I heard I LOVE YOU, only to learn that they were saying OLIVE JUICE. Were they playing with our hearts? Maybe. Were they learning about love and courtship? Probably. Were we fools to believe these utterances were actual reality? Absolutely. This was all part and parcel to the process of passion. We didn't know any better and neither did our parents and their parents before them. These are all games we play to help encode a learning experience as a positive memory for future recall. These moments shape who we are or could be. OLIVE JUICE brings back those early thoughts of the exploration of the human connection.

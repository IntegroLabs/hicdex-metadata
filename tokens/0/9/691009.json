Well, just some artist, that's all. Maybe you'll find me someday, maybe we'll be friends. But I never cared much to earn anything. I'll promptly spend it all away after this.\n\nThis web is a dream. It's only temporary. The peer-to-peer electronic cash is a lie. The unbanked will remain unbanked, and the banked more so. It is not software built to last either.\n\nCherish your friends and hone your skills, and you'll earn things no bitcoin, no tezos or ether can buy. Support open source technologies and create communities.\n\nIf you do buy this token for some reason, do so at least acknowledging maybe things aren't as perfect as you thought. This world isn't either, but together we can change things for the better.\n\nGoodbye.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQwVTUMr6BEgBGwDcQXemgtTLciHN4LobATqVeXwFxrk8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQwVTUMr6BEgBGwDcQXemgtTLciHN4LobATqVeXwFxrk8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQwVTUMr6BEgBGwDcQXemgtTLciHN4LobATqVeXwFxrk8", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LjKbQNxaFYhMxNETVigeRdvbvnq7YTJdL"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

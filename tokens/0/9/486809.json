It can be mixed with water and injected with a needle. Heroin can also be smoked or snorted up the nose. All of these ways of taking heroin send it to the brain very quickly. This makes it very addictive. The people who use heroin report feeling a \"rush\" (a surge of pleasure, or euphoria). However, there are other common effects, including dry mouth, a warm flushing of the skin, heavy feeling in the arms and legs, nausea and vomiting, severe itching, clouded mental functioning, a back-and-forth state of being conscious and semiconscious. In long term the people may develop insomnia, collapsed veins for people who inject the drug, damaged tissue inside the nose for people who sniff or snort it, infection of the heart lining and valves, abscesses, constipation, and stomach cramping, liver and kidney disease, lung complications, including pneumonia, mental disorders, sexual dysfunction for men or irregular menstrual cycles for women.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd7gVXSUVuaYDSspGE12TC6F5LWdYQgNz2m8iU1MByQ83", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd7gVXSUVuaYDSspGE12TC6F5LWdYQgNz2m8iU1MByQ83", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd7gVXSUVuaYDSspGE12TC6F5LWdYQgNz2m8iU1MByQ83", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "nft", "heroin", "collectible"], "extra": {}}

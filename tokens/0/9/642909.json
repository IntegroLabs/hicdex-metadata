She\u2019s not a friend, she\u2019s not a family member but every night, she was there, always doing something weird in the name of her messed up version of love.\n\nIt started with a dream that I was in a room with her and it ended with me being chased by her into my house where she ended up pinning me onto the ground, tying me up and then putting me in bed while \u201ccuddling\u201d next to me. In another dream I watched as everyone at my job turned on me and chanted \u201cshe wants to be alone with you\u201d as she popped up on all of the monitors, proposing marriage toward me in the process. In yet another one, she was behind the wheel of my car when we got into an accident, yet instead of us dying it turned out she intentionally crashed the car so we could be \u201ctogether as one in peace from everyone else!\u201d\n\nI always just thought these were just dreams but the longer it goes on the more she feels more like she's actually there in real life. One night, just before going to sleep I could have sworn I saw that same demon in bed with me for just a split second before I realized it was nothing... but the next night for a full minute I know I saw her on my couch wearing nothing but one of my T-shirts, just laying down in my bed trying to beckon me to come over. The longer this goes on the more I can\u2019t help but wonder is this real and, most importantly, what the hell is going on!?\n\n\u2014-\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied.

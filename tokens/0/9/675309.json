At the beginning of Covid work was quite slow so we were working on updating our website and we needed some photos to show off these custom skate decks we did for the Summer Olympics. Luckily my wife and muse is always willing to be the model for my photoshoots when needed. We hit a few spots in town and ended the day at the city skate park in down town Louisville. Even the most patient of people don't want to spend their entire Saturday driving around and posing for photos so by the end Amanda was READY TO GO. One end of the large complete bowl has an opening which is the easiest way to get out. I was in the middle taking pictures of the graffiti and looked over and saw her standing in the opening, the sun was directly behind her and just from her posture I knew it was time to go. She didn't say a word. She didn't have to. You can say so much without actually speaking especially between people that have spent years together. This piece is about that connection to the people closest to you, and the day I spent with my love.

He is a person split apart by the inability of a familiar coexistence and the pain that comes with the news of a loved ones inevitable and horrific demise. She was always the life of the party, a radiant light in my childhood, and a source of comments others would deem \"innapropriate\" but hilarious. I recently buried her last weekend and wanted to just immortalize the song I had in my head at the time while i was giving a somewhat lackluster eulogy that she proubably would have laughed at. After the funeral a couple of us poured a little bit out of our bottles for the woman who always was willing to pour a little bit out of hers for us (once we were old enough of course...). This is for all the homies out there that have lost someone and felt the sting. Never forget the rainbows they shined upon us..

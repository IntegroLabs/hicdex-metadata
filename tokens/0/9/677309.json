{"__version": 1, "token_id": 677309, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Portrait of a Woman, possibly Ginevra d'Antonio Lupari Gozzadini - 1494", "description": "This portrait and its pendant (1975.1.96) represent a husband and wife of the Gozzadini family of Bologna; the family's coat of arms appears prominently in both paintings. The inscribed architectural frieze in the background, which runs across both panels, attests to the commemorative function of the portraits: VT SIT NOSTRA FORMA SVPERSTES (In order that our features may survive). Probably made to celebrate a betrothal or marriage, the portraits contain numerous allusions to love and matrimony, such as the spray of flowers, known as pinks, held by the male sitter, and the fruit (perhaps a quince) held by his wife. The pelican and phoenix at lower left of the male portrait refer respectively to charity and resurrection - Christian virtues here associated with the sacrament of marriage. In the lower right corner of the female portrait are two rabbits and a girl confronting a unicorn, the former connoting fecundity and the latter chastity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmexYCnEFtUjVTKditV4i5KYQ8oFVD91zBKhkvSpQv711T", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcGdLavZiwKs4He7CUbUtjYMXryQmHWppX21GmC3MCqhu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmexYCnEFtUjVTKditV4i5KYQ8oFVD91zBKhkvSpQv711T", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NCr4Q8ryHn4BrSyGfz56QUXcCDJ53Mzr7"], "tags": ["art"], "extra": {}}

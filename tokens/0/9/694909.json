He watches over the souls of every creature that lives on the savannahs or in the jungles.  \n\nHis heart is forever with people who choose to live wild and free and he loves to hear the laugher of young children.  \n\nTiger watches the door between the visible physical world and the invisible spirit world making sure that every soul stays in it's proper place. \n\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.

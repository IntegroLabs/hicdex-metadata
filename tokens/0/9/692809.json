It was produced by Steve Lillywhite, and was released on 28 February 1983 on Island Records. The album is regarded as U2's first overtly political album, in part because of songs like \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"New Year's Day\", as well as the title, which stems from the band's perception of the world at the time", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZWePJhDhGjo6vQxDi3qdaw4M6ZUEx124383Fkw2UU7L9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcbqmhVBN4oW47XTesh1X7q9baz3TFE7NU1WUCSCReyyJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZWePJhDhGjo6vQxDi3qdaw4M6ZUEx124383Fkw2UU7L9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i9Jbej7sM2TvtpZ9YrJr8wUtpZ91BQ6vf"], "tags": ["digitalrt", "pixelart", "8bit", "album", "cover", "u2", "rock", "irish", "band"], "extra": {}}

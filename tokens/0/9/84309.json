As per this nickname, it is a very territorial, brutal and aggressive coleopter. About twice the size of a goliath beetle, itâ€™s the biggest insect still living known to man, equipped of tough razor-sharp claws, thick chitin and mighty mandibles. When hunting or fighting against its own, it stands on its powerful hind legs, spanning its elytra and front legs to intimidate its opponent. It attacks by leaping forward, using the hydraulic pressure in its body to bounce off its feet, and flaying with its claws extremely fast. When the Battle-Beetle kills its prey or its rival, it will release pheromones to ward off other animals. Its pheromones are brutally painful and effective.","tags":[""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmYd6Gp4HTWohgSjHC7dFAvTBBYKshsKj53NFdDw3odB1k"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYd6Gp4HTWohgSjHC7dFAvTBBYKshsKj53NFdDw3odB1k","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

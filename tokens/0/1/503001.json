{"__version": 1, "token_id": 503001, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Dazl the Priceless Protector", "description": "A young male Dribble who takes on the shape of a draconic Golden Retriever. Even the most stone-faced, god-fearing people can't help but to be melted by his puppy dog eyes everytime. He radiates a natural and intense heat from his body, which begins at his heart and permeates itself outward, eventually building in concentration at the tip of his tail. This heat acts as an inner sun, constantly nourishing Dazl's mane of lush green grass, which can not be damaged or uprooted. His grass of grit is also an empathic entity in theirselves, feeling the emotions of both Dazl, and any riders who are upon his back.\n\nDazl comes with his Glitch Tag, X3 Sparks, X3 Seeds, (all sent to your wallet upon purchase) and a copy of the Official Dribblez Guide to Affinities sent as a PDF to your email address. Let me know your email address upon purchase so I can send it to you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUDZvwJp35dHuBYiQcHfT7SY4Cg86KnavEg7FHd1qG4L4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbNLQ3qPs9ckjkKckZeUSYLghZsumUXDYB8xRtTPfaT1H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUDZvwJp35dHuBYiQcHfT7SY4Cg86KnavEg7FHd1qG4L4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bcr3yotpcZkqKJ8p5jPugcvVHAW5UQiyu"], "tags": ["dragons", "dragon", "doge", "dog", "puppy", "dribblez", "collectible", "tradingcards", "tcg", ""], "extra": {}}

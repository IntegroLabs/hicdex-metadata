He found a fragmented map of the unknown quadrant. Traversing these uncharted areas over the past weeks has granted much knowledge as to the potential whereabouts of the Unknown. \nAlong the way, he's even found some upgrades for Keplar. New shields and a new hyperlink for updating his database, helped uncover more information on the uncharted sectors aswell.\nToday they have come across, a troubling storm. One that is not so easily trekked through. They have found themselves in the middle of the Perished Lands. Home of the Spectral Isles. Thunder cracks, knocking Keplar and the Traveler off of their path. Upon coming to, the Traveler notices that Keplar has finished scanning the area and accesses his map.

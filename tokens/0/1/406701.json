His knowledge comprehends all and He will be the ultimate witness on the day of judgement.\n\nBut Allah bears witness to that which He has revealed to you. He has sent it down with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness [as well]. And sufficient is Allah as Witness. (Quran 4:166)\n\nIt is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion. And sufficient is Allah as Witness. (Quran 48:28)\n\nIndeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Magians and those who associated with Allah \u2013 Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed Allah is, over all things, Witness. (Quran 22:17)\n\nWe will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth. But is it not sufficient concerning your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness?

It is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture and is said to have \"changed the history of architecture\". In 1453, after the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire, it was converted into a mosque. In 1935, the secular Turkish Republic established it as a museum. In 2020, it re-opened as a mosque.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVr35KQvBPYkev36XD6Vc6LcXDv61VrgKtDQDxKUPyd8c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT9xw7faZJUPfMPk4Bh1GZ4UuyDQbDqamYG83CrMMJFBb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVr35KQvBPYkev36XD6Vc6LcXDv61VrgKtDQDxKUPyd8c", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1URfqxYEF9RZEWMuwEDB4xJivA2YJjfpCy"], "tags": ["ART", "DIGITALART", "ILLUSTRATION", "COMPOSITION", "SURREALISM", "COLLECTIBLESS", "NATURE", "CONCEPTUALART", "VISUALPOETRY", "ECOART", "PAINTING", "PICTURES", "GRAPHICS", "ARTWORK", "ARTMOVEMENT", "DRAWING", "CARTOON", "DOODLE"], "extra": {}}

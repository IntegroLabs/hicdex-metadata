{"__version": 1, "token_id": 643101, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Freyja", "description": "In Norse paganism, Freyja \"(the) Lady\") is a goddess associated with love, beauty, fertility, sex, war, gold, and sei\u00f0r (magic for seeing and influencing the future). Freyja is the owner of the necklace Br\u00edsingamen, rides a chariot pulled by two cats, is accompanied by the boar Hildisv\u00edni, and possesses a cloak of falcon feathers. By her husband , she is the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. Along with her twin brother Freyr, her father Nj\u00f6rdr, and her mother (Nj\u00f6rdr's sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir. Stemming from Old Norse Freyja, modern forms of the name include Freya, Freyia, and Freja.\n\nFreyja rules over her heavenly field, F\u00f3lkvangr, where she receives half of those who die in battle. The other half go to the god Odin's hall, Valhalla. Within F\u00f3lkvangr lies her hall, Sessr\u00famnir. Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful j\u00f6tnar who wish to make her their wife. Freyja's husband, the god \u00d3\u00f0r, is frequently absent. She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names. Freyja has numerous names, including Gefn, H\u00f6rn, Mard\u00f6ll, S\u00fdr, and Vanad\u00eds.\n\nNorse mythology\n.Odin\n.Thor\n.Loki\n.Freya\n.Baldur\n.Frigg", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT5SetD23ynjYRtTHihR5phGVCiBYh859owQ2Ro7QwFLv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT5SetD23ynjYRtTHihR5phGVCiBYh859owQ2Ro7QwFLv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT5SetD23ynjYRtTHihR5phGVCiBYh859owQ2Ro7QwFLv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R4FrYfMq3J2hRxaanXSH7A1GRR9Sms6ZN"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

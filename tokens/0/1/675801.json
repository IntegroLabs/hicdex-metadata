{"__version": 1, "token_id": 675801, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SMALL TO LARGE", "description": "Word ladders can seem like nonsensical coincidences on the surface, but what would happen if we added scale to the scope of the conceptual connotation? The result could yield a new way to perceive the overall arch of word comprehension as well as visual representation. Case and point, the word ladder between the word opposites of SMALL and LARGE. The image illustrates how the word SMALL is small and it progressively gets larger via a new word as it travels down the ladder to LARGE. What I love about this is that it's a new permutation to the word ladder series. It's a different level of rarity within the English language that these autological words that define themselves literally connect to one another using other words. It doesn't get much more meta than that.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXZLYTM2XkzNroUaSY7FhicrYgyBcqQWSafTK7yzA1WDE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQjWCkNmD5wTUUsoV296qkFkbNum3WgYGKWvJoAr9fjZ3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXZLYTM2XkzNroUaSY7FhicrYgyBcqQWSafTK7yzA1WDE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

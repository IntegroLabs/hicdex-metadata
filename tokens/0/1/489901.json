Background audio (warning: noisy!) is the custom audio signal used to create the line drawings.\n\nThe 15MHz dual-trace Tektronix Type 516 is vacuum-tube based.  It was introduced in 1960 and contains no transistors.  Thousands of Type 516s were produced (Grandpa Tek is S/N 003969,) but few operational units remain.\n\nOscilloscope Art - XY oscilloscope trace of custom designed audio sample.  Modern data fed into obsolete tech.\n15 second loop.  Handheld capture on Tektronix Type 516 tube oscilloscope.  30fps.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZquKbzVqwdgn2V4BDQLn9UR1sAFUqi9xC9k4ve65w9DM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNcukLS8BiZQ59rDAxjmVDrrg1rfpmtSPXU7rmh1ddzZX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZquKbzVqwdgn2V4BDQLn9UR1sAFUqi9xC9k4ve65w9DM", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2JaQCjRcBr2KPNtwYPZEsFYc76ncckGSsD"], "tags": ["oscilloscope", "lineart", "obsoletetech", "1970s", "analog", "vacuumtubes", "tektronix"], "extra": {}}

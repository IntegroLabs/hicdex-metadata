Bringing back a chain of memories (lol) with the Kingdom Hearts series & remembering just how impactful it was playing it for the first time. The original Kingdom Hearts for PS2 was the first game that I ever completed through as far as story modes go in rpgs. From story to music production everything was so moving & I was never so invested in a game because most of my time was spent on other hobbies. Then on top of that, growing up with the Smash Bros franchise and it coming to an end, (my favorite video game to play) I just started tearing ESPECIALLY this last visual on the Sora reveal showcasing all the characters behind both Mario & Sora. Like what an amazing close with beautiful symbolism. I know better fan art for a final smash tribute would definitely be one with the whole cast for this is the biggest gaming collaboration with generations worth of historic content, but this scene just really hit all the feels & I felt really impelled to add a bit of me to that scene. I think if the original KH game didn\u2019t have such an impact, especially with the orchestra during his reveal \ud83d\ude2d I wouldn\u2019t have been as satisfied, but more so just sad that smash came to an expected end. This was just perfect. The end of an era. Where did my childhood go \ud83d\ude2d (take me back lol). For all of the memories growing up & your hard work bringing all of this together, Thank you Sakurai. Fun fact: The name /no5ay_ was originally my gamer tag for when I wanted to get into competitive Smash bros\u2026that didn\u2019t exactly play out \ud83d\ude02 but I was serious for a second and creating a lot of gaming content at one point. The name itself has a deeper meaning for me and just because I chose to not pursue gaming at that level, I just had to keep it. Glad to see things come full circle to where now I\u2019m still able to use this name with something so dear & personal to me. I AM SO INSPIRED NOW & STILL EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT. BRB GONNA GO CRY WHILE LISTENING TO \"DEARLY BELOVED\" FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.\n\n\nFor more you can follow @no5ay._ on instagram\nAlso feel free to follow my twitter @no5ay_ where I will try to navigate in this new digital world and community with my social anxiety. I haven't been brave enough to really say much on there anymore, but I hope to find confidence in my life again through just the pure love of creating visuals & feeling them. If you collect anything from me, pls let me know! I'd love to tweet thank you for vibing with me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfDsTj41x9wd5dGfNZvYjWjDyv2AhpyarB611DUMcFVpQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQYpq7JFcUgchAqKwvTmZF2PGZgutkTFgvu2AudB2jduj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfDsTj41x9wd5dGfNZvYjWjDyv2AhpyarB611DUMcFVpQ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MVGesL1NyxCCdd3Fn5W8dPvgEL5n2bwwc"], "tags": ["no5ay_", "super", "smash", "bros", "mario", "sora", "gaming", "history", "epic", "childhood", "memories", "digital", "art", "paint", "abstract", "ultimate", "fan-art"], "extra": {}}

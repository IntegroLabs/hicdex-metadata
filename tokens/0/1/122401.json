But there I was on a beautiful July morning in 2012 walking through the Henry Cowell Redwood Forest and I was seeing people from all over the world taking pictures of kids & grandparents together standing inside these massive things. Of course I had no interest in big trees let alone standing inside them so I explored & found this decaying redwood with a tip of sunlight coming down as if to give this tree it's last rights. I got on my knees to take a shot & saw something but needed to get the right angle. I layed on my back in dead bugs, tree and who knows what else to get the sun hit it just right. Almost to the top of it's feeble & desolate trunk was this booming spider web full of egg sacks. Life was starting anew upon the ending era of a giant, tell that isn't life being truly poetic? The kicker is everyone was laughing at the kid on his back taking pictures at the sky (from their perspective) but come to find out, it wasn't that at all. They had found out I unintentionally was laying directly on Bear scat!

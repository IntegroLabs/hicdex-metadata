I saw the clouds and I imagined that there was someone up there, crying. This skull represents the life that I've been through. Sometimes life can get hard and all you want to do is cry your eyes out. But actually, deep inside, your life is also full of colors. You've been through a lot of beautiful experiences and that's why I used these colors to represent his tears. \n\nBear this is mind that life WILL definitely get hard and it's fine if you want to cry. But don't ever forget that it's also beautiful.\n\nLiebe Gr\u00fc\u00dfe aus Hamburg,\nTegar\n\n2268 x 4032", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbVgb7tGW6FJhFdgbozw6npDw8uHpRHZvUE7VN99mAWkf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmccqkMPSS6i716UhCGVFho4U5hXYnu2rFN7qMTwwvjL8U", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbVgb7tGW6FJhFdgbozw6npDw8uHpRHZvUE7VN99mAWkf", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Amn89MtzAfX8mzUZfcUpQJqpa8uep7aQv"], "tags": ["photography", "illustration", "doodles", "buildings", "Hamburg", "shigarakii_", "sky"], "extra": {}}

You may never know what goes on behind the scenes. This is an animation I made when dealing with being overwhelmed by the mask I have tried to keep in \"place\" to deal with my scoliosis. Being braced for a significant part of my life I have found myself in moments where I felt like I was stuck in the mirrors of my pain like an endless reflection. The color scheme reflects the darkness that tries to over take us and at times can be blinding. Despite it all we are bent not broken. Find beauty in your pain.

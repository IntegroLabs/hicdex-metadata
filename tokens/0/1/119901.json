It was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery in 1888. Millions of people were brought over from Africa, more than to any other country in the world and that has left deep scars. The Brazilian state didn't create any kind of public policy to integrate black people in society, subsequently opened its country to white immigrants, who were given preference over black people in jobs, housing and education. Afro-Brazilians still face major disadvantages and institutionalized discrimination. The severe inequalities faced by Afro-descendants are reflected in every area of their lives, from health and education to employment and wealth. Homicide remains the main cause of death among Brazilian youth, particularly affecting young black males living in favelas and urban areas. This is an anti racism GIF inspired by 12 portraits of brazilian ex-slaves made by Alberto Henschel, the original photographs can be found at the Leibniz-Institut Für Länderkunde.

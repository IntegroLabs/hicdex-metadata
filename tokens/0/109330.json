After an enthusiastic initial meeting I began the months long process of painting each flower and building the digital bouquet.  Once complete some small images where sent to the florist and I waited for the go ahead to print the edition.  With no money exchanged and no contracts signed, I was ghosted by the florist and the project never progressed to further works or made it to print.  This digital file became a warning of how artists can be taken advantage of in the world of business and is a reminder of how important the smart contract can be.  As I mint Still Life 13.0 I reflect on the potential the NFT holds to empower artists.  I am grateful for the chance to connect this lost project with an audience that holds appreciation for how much time and effort it takes to create art.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQA1RB1TKvuRK3NF1MrFhiwR2dFzBZHSnyCCtb1XNchbF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdLDcNQXZUSZKATz2oe68xmyBvmpgKwo57ykiw2zw8h8h", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1dmg96RoGHGbKydeKDaqxsmvkT26QPR7vz"], "tags": ["fizzpop", "stilllife", "digital", "contemporary", "painting", "art", "commercial", "flowers"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/png", "uri": "ipfs://QmQA1RB1TKvuRK3NF1MrFhiwR2dFzBZHSnyCCtb1XNchbF"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmbLgpE7ocK7M6TteDNoJFhf8DidDcZdX5tgw1CJqr6os9"}, "supply": "25", "transfered": 0}

I was born in Italy in 1991 in a town close to Milan. Growing up, I was always passionate about art, especially interested in creating. My father was a Journalist and Graphic Designer, and thanks to him, I have started drawing and develop an artistic sense from a young age. I got into tribal masks during art lessons in high school, I was so fascinated by cubist artists like Picasso and how he explored the African style.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQLFmFHSH8x2bsTHu3o72CZSqQHvqV1gVbBpH2xa4hw3Q","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1gZc62y2fzaFCtMdy4WJUuD1CEoSWYt5su"],"tags":["Spirit","Buffalo","Theo.Cerri"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmQLFmFHSH8x2bsTHu3o72CZSqQHvqV1gVbBpH2xa4hw3Q"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmTWojEDrUSSwJaJsNRQYFVNq8FokzyB77qTHpLy6bkvS3"},"supply":"6","transfered":6}

My digital journey started in the 90s in elementary school were I did my first animation using the Logo Programming Language. This turtle was some kind of “cursor” that showed output from commands for movement. Since then, my love for bringing pixels to life kept growing stronger. It fulfilled my desire to push my creative limits and I can proudly say that since 2011, animation puts food on my table. I’ll always remember you Mr. Turtle!","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQ7BXfKZidQXXvRGeA3PQtTCJq7DVbrnsfu7bjgKiHU79","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz2KpfKzshGg3caVDSdh7q3jSjR7Zh3kHDtJ"],"tags":["animation","logowriter","aftereffects","logowriter","turtle"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmQ7BXfKZidQXXvRGeA3PQtTCJq7DVbrnsfu7bjgKiHU79"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmdYcRuKwJkXaj9RYPxH83JTB8mbdfBbCzVRPcr3U3GqJ2"},"supply":"5","transfered":4}

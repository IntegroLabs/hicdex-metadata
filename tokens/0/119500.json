{"name": "Smolest Chimney", "description": "This is smol version of my photograph \"Simple Chimney 3\" taken back in 2018 on my island Paxos. I like looking up when i am walking home. I like looking at the old chimneys and how some have kept a certain style or work. Traditional art was manifested usually through common things that were used in the house or displayed on it. Chimneys were and still are like that. 16x16px ", "tags": ["bbSmol", "smol", "pixel", "bbseries", "pixelart", "experiment", "colors", "pixel", "abstract", "smolexception", "smolgang", "smolphotography", "chimney"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmNZhiZ7Nhm6mXzvGHtBwKrgPb9Y4gxC19TpmaJLtLrCJW", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmavgRaG7ycBL1aNWxoodjYaseeF5brL17znoFdxjMuNnV", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1eJyuKHtG5Z2jxdJVywu86qu7PxXzbpcuY"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNZhiZ7Nhm6mXzvGHtBwKrgPb9Y4gxC19TpmaJLtLrCJW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

{"name": "The Daily Fare.", "description": "19.12.03 // I remember I was travelling back home from work when I made this photograph. The auto rides in Mumbai are really something. Especially at night. The flashy lights of the dream city, the heavy traffic on the roads full of potholes and the sudden cool breeze at night when you pass through some specific parts of Mumbai is something you can only appreciate once you experience it.

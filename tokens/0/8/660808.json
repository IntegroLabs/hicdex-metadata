So I took a break from it all, Twitter and the whole scene. I was able to do so and not be fixated on losing ground or making a shill post. It was nice and so this is what I got is something that is 10% the quality of my previous animations! enjoy.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR963btHJqcZ2D7TnrwFPYmaH3Dq6wfKgmLTdeFgyCjwu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR963btHJqcZ2D7TnrwFPYmaH3Dq6wfKgmLTdeFgyCjwu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR963btHJqcZ2D7TnrwFPYmaH3Dq6wfKgmLTdeFgyCjwu", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1LnavCNnCHhqnixzTK9xwwELdcnTtsDFro"], "tags": ["animated-gig", "animated", "colorful"], "extra": {}}

A house that is small because it\u2019s filled with stuffs we love. Stuffs that we don\u2019t want to get rid of our house.  Not because of the stuff, but because of the stories that comes together with it. That stupid ceramic, the awkward garden gnome with big teeth that scares the kids and even that weird thing I always keep in my memory box (even if I have no idea what it means 8 years later) and that ugly undone mushroom lamp I made. Keep it, keep it all. A house made of wood, a home made of moments.  \n\nAnalog collage made from paper trash on canvas board\nNovember 2021 - @elsadiora", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQdY2zhGY8DGoWcSg34Py531wfNXpJiSbQSMycQJQwk5k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRij2ZWSrJEoMgPCDgSiDAEaqyzv4PQdepBCpEBbTzzNF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQdY2zhGY8DGoWcSg34Py531wfNXpJiSbQSMycQJQwk5k", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MTnNuKrSpz3WXsrCMZoX9Pb8N69bEVoDT"], "tags": ["collage", "analogcollage", "collageart", "lines", "red", "detail", "raw", "billboard", "recycle", "upcycle", "paperbits", "elsadiora", "els", "trash", "paper", "analog", "analogart"], "extra": {}}

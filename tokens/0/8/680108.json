{"__version": 1, "token_id": 680108, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ISLAND VIEW", "description": "Similar to ELEPHANT SHOE, ISLAND VIEW is a bit of a lesser known version of this romantic homophonic phenomenon of silently mouthing other words to make your mouth look like it's saying I LOVE YOU. It's definitely rarer to hear this one, but still valid nonetheless. Love takes many guises throughout our lives. It morphs from what we think love should be to what we have in front of us. ISLAND VIEW simplifies, distracts, and abstracts our true intentions with juvenile joy to those we actually love and care about. For so many, openly loving with all our hearts to others can be a scary prospect, especially for those who are first learning how to love another person. Memories can deceive us over time. What we remember may not exactly match reality, but with that being said, we will always have that first moment that we will never forget; when we first fell in love. Someone said, \"I love you\" first and then someone replied, \"I love you too\", like an amorous volley going back and forth between lovers.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUxZpsavyDi1w81moxCmRysX57VsFxFv76itfSh5MGTss", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWKrM3sf2Cm9kbuuUnZcPNVpTKy49oGpseuVs3cuwzujR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUxZpsavyDi1w81moxCmRysX57VsFxFv76itfSh5MGTss", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

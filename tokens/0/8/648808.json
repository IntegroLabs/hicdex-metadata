These beings reflect the math that describes the fundamental nature of our world, from how plants and animals grow to how lands shift over eons. These infinitely complex forms reflect that which drives our universe and the language that motivates it, Each form appears differently to each subject, acting as a sort of interdimensional Rorschach test, written in the language of existence and reflective of ones own subconscious tendencies.

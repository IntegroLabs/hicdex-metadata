{"__version": 1, "token_id": 696908, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "FRUITION", "description": "Ahhh and here we have another fun word zipper to lift the proverbial spirit. This time it's the zipping of the words FRUIT and ION into FRUITION. If we individually look at the words we can extract more meaning. So FRUIT is fairly obvious, we eat and gain nourishment from them; they are part of our reality on just about every corner of the globe. What is truly interesting about this one is how we can play with the definitions of ION that we can use as a pun of sorts. An ION can be a noun as in an atom or group of atoms that carries a positive or negative electric charge as a result of having lost or gained one or more electrons or a suffix at the end of a word. As the suffix -ION, it can mean an act or process validation, the result of an act or process regulation, and/or a state or condition. When we combine the words to create FRUITION, how does the ION relate to our newly zippered word? Atoms are always in a state or a condition; liquid, solid, gas, plasma, Bose-Einstein condensate, or newly discovered time crystal. They are usually looking to be in their most stable form. We can make the parable that joining FRUIT and ION together is like atoms coming together to form a bonds to form molecules to form a fruit. So the combination of the two is the FRUITION of how matter forms itself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZCbn65DSmqrbMNLJc5hDh4zR6dq8qb8HmTT1emkj8f4u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXGAKj8B1CHbE4y2syyYwigk9NYwanFqvnadKZYB8RtPu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZCbn65DSmqrbMNLJc5hDh4zR6dq8qb8HmTT1emkj8f4u", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

His last meal is a pathetic microwaved dinner. The same one he’s eaten for the last decade. His cat dutifully shoves heaving spoonfuls into his agape mouth. Hoping his suffering ends sooner rather than later. This is the climax of his forgettable existence. Dying alone with an animal that’s grown to resent him. It will be over soon. And no one outside of his cat will know or care. He’s incapable of considering his inconsequence in this world. Focusing only on the food traveling slowly down his throat.","tags":["diewiththemostlikes","loopdelaila","collaboration","sadness","death","doom","cats"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmPSX8JGnAJ9tesKR4YGiQxPk8AUAdzKXxFb9Z4RSzpe2d","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPSX8JGnAJ9tesKR4YGiQxPk8AUAdzKXxFb9Z4RSzpe2d","display_uri":"ipfs://QmPGEWasVfydr2AiDYbUGTC9NBAiF6VGFghRwMdYejkSzT","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

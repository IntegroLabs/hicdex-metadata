This was taught to her by Eastern Shoshone elder Benny LeBeau aka Bavado, of RIP. She sings and moves counterclockwise in a circle to open up the vortex and then does other things to get the energy spinning. She sings, dances & sends healing thoughts and emotions out through the spokes of the wheel into all of  the Earth & up into the sky. This clears the old energies and refreshes the land.~ Also on youtube NFTeve Interviews channel.

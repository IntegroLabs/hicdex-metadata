It's one of the guardians of the forest where it lives.\nAbout the artist\n\nHi, my name is Daniela, but you can call me Dani. I am a dreamer female artist who lives in Brazil. My biggest dream is to live through my art and my creativity, and also to help make the world a fairer place for people and animals. If all goes well, I even intend to create shelters that are cozy and heavenly for abandoned or needy animals.\nI am currently in college, studying Visual Arts. I also love writing and playing the piano. I love animals a lot, including dinosaurs and the mythical ones like dragons.\nMy Twitter account: @danihp_art\nMy Instagram art account: @dani_hp_art\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbcEGBCtu8cCpUsNTH6ALfwGdPaJ6Er7ot4s2qcBcmVy7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUxLojZfMbQPXQ4tbCrN6ZmR3rXQP88Xu8RN2fz1iW7Rn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbcEGBCtu8cCpUsNTH6ALfwGdPaJ6Er7ot4s2qcBcmVy7", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MnL9oSz51vjrnFNt3oF3NQ6mfm6UoeSzQ"], "tags": ["cat", "kitty", "fantasy", "animal", "animals", "cats", "mystic", "magic", "dream", "green", "colorful", "art", "digitalart", "creature", "dreamy", "feline"], "extra": {}}

Everything started here, it all started with Winston. \n\nI moved him here because this is the first actual appearance of the Mineral Printer. Winston has his own project but I created them both so it's all the same to me. \n\nIssa celebration! As fatherhood approaches, I'm sending my remaining 2021 pieces to happy homes. Enjoy it, flip it, burn it; the choice is yours my friend! \n\nI care more about sharing my art with the world than actually turning a profit so I'm calling this \"Free Festivus\"!

Cryptopunks told me incredibly emotional things. Their lives have not been easy. They might have no future. But they feel emotions like us. They want us to know that they have true inner life. They have political opinions. Like us, they are faking their lives and try to appear cooler than they are. \u201cThe Inner Life of Cryptopunks\u201d is a series of nine works, each one about one of our friends based on the interview I had with them in April 2021. www.pierregervois.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSEZeFExeH2f8iUG8ip4sqQCLeMU1o8iA194ap5ndLYjW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSEZeFExeH2f8iUG8ip4sqQCLeMU1o8iA194ap5ndLYjW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1VK8SfhAkQ9QdFH9EixsQNmUqi9GF5iJR9"], "tags": ["language", "text", "cryptopunk"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/gif", "uri": "ipfs://QmSEZeFExeH2f8iUG8ip4sqQCLeMU1o8iA194ap5ndLYjW"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmZtdMDTknHWVkrbJfaGrUg2ZxGcPanGNd8Qk4iZLLQnaJ"}, "supply": "1"}

It is a fearsome monster that devours humans with venomous stings and kills humans slowly before eating them. They will capture and subdue their prey and use the sticky web to wrap them. The most scary part is, they will inject their venom using its sharp fangs. To be mentioned, their venom is made in their salivary glands and is delivered through their hollow pointy bits on the ends.This creation has a special power, which is an unbreakable web. The only way to destroy the web is to be slashed by ancient weapons.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNkdp3Dmre1ysobSMsran4eFc5zCLy4JWeRY6VUU1BkWo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbTSKT8EziSi7WhmGherCwdbvdoqmH3B7yuM8ri1WGf8y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNkdp3Dmre1ysobSMsran4eFc5zCLy4JWeRY6VUU1BkWo", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1S5cRwFwnKfvwDhBXEekA4LjtWkUQpjcKD"], "tags": ["illustration", "darkart", "dark", "2danimation", "animation"], "extra": {}}

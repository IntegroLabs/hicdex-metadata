The first couple of letters released were just made in editions of 2 and the Scrabble quantities of some of them are way off so this is a make-up edition for the Letter E, E Is For Eleven. It took me a while to come up with another good word for E but when Eleven dawned on me and I started watching Stranger Things again it made me remember just how great that show really is...and how awesome Eleven is as a young female hero. Of course I love the 80's so the whole environment of ST is great in addition to the moody tunes from SURVIVE make this another show worth re-watching.

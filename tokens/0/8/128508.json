In a liquid measuring cup, combine the ice water and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and, with the machine running, slowly drizzle the mixture in through the feed tube until a ball of sticky dough forms, 20 to 30 seconds. Move to an oiled work surface and knead until smooth, 2 to 4 minutes. Plop into an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight before using. Make the pizza sauce In a food processor, combine the tomatoes and their juices, garlic, salt, oregano, red pepper flakes, basil, and sugar. Process until smooth. \u261eTESTER TIP: You\u2019ll likely have a lot more pizza sauce than you need. Freeze any remaining sauce for up to 3 months and thaw the next time a New York style pizza craving hits.  Assemble the New York style pizza Divide the chilled dough into 2 equal pieces. Wrap individually in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour. While the dough is resting, set an oven rack in the second highest position and place a pizza stone on it. Preheat the oven to 550\u00b0F (288\u00b0C) or the highest setting for 1 hour. Dust a pizza peel with half the semolina flour. \u261eTESTER TIP: If you don\u2019t have a pizza peel, an overturned baking sheet will work nicely in its place. If you don\u2019t have a pizza stone, you can assemble and cook the pizza on a heavy rimmed baking sheet.  Generously dust a work surface with all-purpose flour and place one piece of the dough on top. Pressing gently with your fingertips, push the dough out to form an 8-inch (20-cm) round, leaving the edge slightly thicker. Pick up the round of dough and drape it over your knuckles, letting gravity stretch it. Pass the dough hand over hand until you have about a 14-inch (35-cm) round. Transfer the dough to the prepared pizza peel and reshape it into a circle, if necessary, leaving the edge slightly thicker. Depending on how saucy you like your pizza, ladle 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the pizza sauce onto the dough and spread until evenly coated, making sure to leave a 1/2-inch (12-mm) border exposed. Scatter half the mozzarella over the sauce. Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone and bake until the crust is well browned and the cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 10 to 12 minutes. Using the pizza peel, move the pie to a large cutting board or pizza pan. Repeat with the remaining dough, sauce, and cheese to make a second pizza. Slice each pizza into about 8 wedges and devour.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmebHXQUusS2vYJavCm2hyYWojC7LDCSeUjYqAwnitMJ58", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRTw7UdaFyEL1ktGnujWNzDux4J7pbQjN3MiirNxgZN9D", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmebHXQUusS2vYJavCm2hyYWojC7LDCSeUjYqAwnitMJ58", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1csaF9qoUB4y9MwgQttDJYLKw5x6acb399"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

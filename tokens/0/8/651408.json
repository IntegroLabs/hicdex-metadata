Each word has 11 letters and they are each one letter away from the one above it or below it. Technically, we could lose the 7 letter \"INESSES\" part of each word to achieve the ladder, but what the hell, let's push the envelope; that's what this is all about. I'm not looking to create safe artwork. There is an innate drive to locate, discover, and share these findings as if they were a newly uncovered Rosetta Stone basking in the sunlight for the first time in ages. Is all of this useless drivel? Maybe, but maybe it's important to show the hidden world of words.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcedBv4DNexnuQM8eierDQNXFGhXnLspxqetmhn2vtnEa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcDknjrR9GQEqTUC1756mcpewYtdXvN4EScLvh15KLHDm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcedBv4DNexnuQM8eierDQNXFGhXnLspxqetmhn2vtnEa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

In the tale, a man recounts how he survived a shipwreck and a whirlpool. It has been grouped with Poe's tales of ratiocination and also labeled an early form of science fiction.\nThe story is told by an old man who reveals that he only appears old\u2014\"You suppose me a very old man,\" he says, \"but I am not. It took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves.\" The narrator, convinced by the power of the whirlpools he sees in the ocean beyond, is then told of the \"old\" man's fishing trip with his two brothers a few years ago.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPjSBAjVWK8fupvMETg5nsi6mBwQnBmfR9kKf8brPwo9J", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbFWyi1Y6eN7fDvwQ71qffmYQGFidDFb1eanvTKAezabv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPjSBAjVWK8fupvMETg5nsi6mBwQnBmfR9kKf8brPwo9J", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Zrzs1sC9BHbRwtDgFrNC4fkZ5cXMw83ch"], "tags": ["codeart", "generativeart", "piano", "minimalart", "abstract", "mathart", "psychedelic", "minimal"], "extra": {}}

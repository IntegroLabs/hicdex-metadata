It was not the first space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed primarily to conduct infrared astronomy. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led development of the telescope in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The JWST was launched 25 December 2021 on an ESA Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana and is intended to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as NASA's flagship mission in astrophysics.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRmWJACxt3kpmJWRCo5dc9NTFHo1CkhCZ4N746JmQvnqY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRmWJACxt3kpmJWRCo5dc9NTFHo1CkhCZ4N746JmQvnqY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRmWJACxt3kpmJWRCo5dc9NTFHo1CkhCZ4N746JmQvnqY", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1MsVxCPtUjRLrWiJd5co76vhkmk4sbwHfY"], "tags": ["space"], "extra": {}}

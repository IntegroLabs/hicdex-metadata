{"name": "Struggle: See the Forest Through the Trees", "description": "When we are caught up in a situation, we often only see the obstacles immediately ahead: the trees of life that block our natural path, through thick weaves of branches. Although, it is important that we step back and look at the bigger picture: the forest that we have journeyed through, the obstacles we have faced and conquered, and how far we've come. And, through the bigger picture, we can often find beauty in how far we've come, and how we're now stronger heading to where we want to go.", "tags": ["struggle", "perseverance", "beauty", "nature", "ai", "art", "butterfly"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmcznYRvKJQNr78Lg2ykjiaUNRYY6ZJkMg5HzmhiRA277Q", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmcznYRvKJQNr78Lg2ykjiaUNRYY6ZJkMg5HzmhiRA277Q", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1ZSn8mpeNAdPLfDYqzCYwU1QAGEEGEksit"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcznYRvKJQNr78Lg2ykjiaUNRYY6ZJkMg5HzmhiRA277Q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

When will it finally stop?\" In fact there is no other word to tell us. Why? Because all men have rights that they have for themselves. And, just as they all have a natural right to privacy and freedom of speech, so women have a natural right to freedom of religion. But no one has actually asked to read these Bible passages, because they are the most popular, the most sacred, the most reliable: \"But if a man shall speak to any prophet, a man shall call on him; and the one that shall speak, he shall not speak with the prophet from the place of his mouth, but with him from under his feet. \"And it shall come to pass, that in these books a man shall be permitted to pray as he pleases, and an angel shall come through them, and an angel of God shall stand behind a man and pray as he pleases.\" And if a man should preach these things, and that person should make use of them, and do all they say, he shall be not allowed to speak on their account.\n\n\n\nai generated text", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUqagFTgLqHstBTesjsmrqyN6MahBQ6BvwkxcqmLxapaX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUqagFTgLqHstBTesjsmrqyN6MahBQ6BvwkxcqmLxapaX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUqagFTgLqHstBTesjsmrqyN6MahBQ6BvwkxcqmLxapaX", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1hnE4Kyqi8HqtP9pnZ86Fa4B5M1M4HEvRN"], "tags": ["generativeart", "gif", "ai", "animation", "loop", "punkgans", "trippy"], "extra": {}}

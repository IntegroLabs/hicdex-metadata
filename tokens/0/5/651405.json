We think we are the alpha and the omega of our consciousnesses. We make choices every moment of every second of every minute of every day. Everything around us is a story; we create the meaning. In the short window of existence we all are gifted, our journeys diverge like quantum bubbles moving through particle fields in the fabric of spacetime; popping once we die, our life's energy transferred back to the source.

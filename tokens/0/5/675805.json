{"__version": 1, "token_id": 675805, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "CHANCE / CHANGE / CHARGE", "description": "Venn diagrams always have a special nerd-like quality to me. The whole point to a Venn diagram is to visualize how a group of ideas, things, etc. overlap and share commonalities. In this case, this diagram isn't necessarily accurate as the overlapping information doesn't quite sync up, but we have an overall effect how we can parse out information into these circular shapes. Fun fact about these three words is that this is also a tiny word ladder. Let's investigate. Starting with CHANCE we can move down the ladder to CHANGE and then to CHARGE. Beyond the word ladder, in the center we have the shared overlap between all 3 words, which is the prefix CHA. From there we're able to put the suffixes in the other circles and within the overlap areas we have the words created from this formation. Where the Venn diagram breakdown in terms of effectiveness is that within these overlap areas, there should be a combination or some sort of amalgamation of both suffixes, meaning it technically should say CHARGE & CHANCE in one, CHARGE & CHANGE in another, and CHANGE & CHANCE in the last overlap. That being said, it would have looked too busy, so I cut out all the duplicate information and simplified it for elegance. This is a good example of how minimalism can be an effective way to communicate ideas; less is more.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbGFRqCnagcZ84YAygjsuPmF8FsbvdJiZGfX58rN2ZYBQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaPtsazJADUQBuRaGksidtKG7yegYoaAytJ6LDa3CAawX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbGFRqCnagcZ84YAygjsuPmF8FsbvdJiZGfX58rN2ZYBQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

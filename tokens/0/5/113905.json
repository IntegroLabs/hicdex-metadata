The Voynich Manuscript defies classification and has  also defied comprehension. Cryptologists, FBI operatives, respected medievalists, mathematic and scientific scholars, skilled linguists... theyâ€™ve all been left stumped.  Even Alan Turing took a crack at it and came up short. It is currently located at Yale university.  To this day nobody knows how to read this book.","tags":["mystery","riddles","yale","3d","animation","book"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmczgGppDeMGQ73innhcaumXAZ3dH1hKQPZHPKKGpdrj58"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmczgGppDeMGQ73innhcaumXAZ3dH1hKQPZHPKKGpdrj58","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVS6biQyjU4FXQRB8UvVKXTeTotA7CW4tuJWABiQyb5h8","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

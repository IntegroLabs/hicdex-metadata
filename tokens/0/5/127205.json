I was proud because it was the first time I made a 3D animation, something I didn't know I could do. The idea I had in mind at that moment was that I wanted to portray my character as a confident person, someone I am not. I've always wanted to feel comfortable inside my own skin, but society has changed the way I see myself. To my dismay, I had to leave MP after feeling overlooked as a new artist and having encountered many problems with the platform itself. Up until today, this piece was never sold and I wanted to change that. I know that the 100-day event is over, but I want to give it a nice home. Thank you for your time.

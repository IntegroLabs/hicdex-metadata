This includes all numbers 1-100 including the elusive #003 which was lost in limbo during the original HEN exploit and is now only available as part of this piece.\nThis piece will provide utility for all holders; as a holder you will receive the 2nd 100 piece for free when it drops, you will also receive all special releases free of charge, including some which will not be available for sale to the public. Additionally there may be some special unannounced incentives down the line. I will also provide a HI RES version of this piece upon request since I had to compress it and downsize it from it's original 8K version to get it to fit on here.\n4096x2160", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma4TKHVXnnN1D36QTXS3teMuEqbcBkuBKmuRCnpTQvF4y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcJhPiyLm5bqSrEGxBbq6nSVv9kQCVmj5b2HshnG2GBHA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma4TKHVXnnN1D36QTXS3teMuEqbcBkuBKmuRCnpTQvF4y", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television", "PleaseStandBy"], "extra": {}}

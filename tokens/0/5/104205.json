Now, half a century later, as I share these in a digital marketplace full of artists hawking their wares, I hope these photos remind us all of the humanity behind the transactions. This photo was taken in beautiful Kabul, Afghanistan, circa 1970 (this was before the Russians and the Taliban left their mark on the country).  Kabul had very few fixed stores, so most goods were sold at stalls on the street.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmajTqPsica9pfYgYgABtTfqJzuzegVn62NhRRBfjheNLM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdbQHVCwPi41Yfia76XcPrXQhEG7GQ9qtQK9MJ6ijAbqG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1gS3Haj9KP3yypf7HBWJSuLzykTwTTDc7y"], "tags": ["photo", "photography", "vietnam", "kabul", "afghanistan", "1970"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmajTqPsica9pfYgYgABtTfqJzuzegVn62NhRRBfjheNLM"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmUpCBpfSpjAhEsMUnoKLUqpnNK4iNMZcXzpN1mr5fpBPu"}, "supply": "12", "transfered": 0}

You can\u2019t experience an ice cream reading its ingredients, but only if you taste it. The meaning of all life in this endless multiverse is, to reach and join a higher level of consciousness. This is the general and eternal algorithm, every single particle strives in this direction.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS7yZYfB9iJQ5e2WWBgcGMnAmmMLqnqat1PGia8f3oiDy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS7yZYfB9iJQ5e2WWBgcGMnAmmMLqnqat1PGia8f3oiDy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS7yZYfB9iJQ5e2WWBgcGMnAmmMLqnqat1PGia8f3oiDy", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iofz19pHfHgwM1zb5iuoLwzshJbTFQBWc"], "tags": ["Rorschach", "inkblot", "klexography", "spiritual", "abstract"], "extra": {}}

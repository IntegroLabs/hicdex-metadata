{"__version": 1, "token_id": 680105, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ELEPHANT SHOE", "description": "Are you ready for some more reductive syntax word crystals? I'm sure at some point when you were in school, you heard someone say 'Elephant Shoe'. Think back to that moment; remember. Do you remember saying it to a girl, a boy, or a person you liked? Or did they say it to you from the other side of the classroom? It looked like they were saying, \"I Love You.\" when they silently mouthed it to you. In this work, we're exploring the homophonic phenomenon that for generations has been amusing young people in their never-ending search for love and acceptance. We can clearly see as the layers progress downwards, how ELEPHANT SHOE morphs into I LOVE YOU. Each sentence becomes more and more condensed. (Wait a minute Andrew, are you trying to make a memory of a moment 30 years ago into a work of art with words?) Yup, you bet and why not? Memories are there for us to remember, that's why they're memories. Let's remember together.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQZagg1H7UD2YC5kNCYN1evjZS9rimpyHbZ9P9GGdosiF", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme1xCS8tVBVhsnhC7oSAtmyoHSW3AKZczKkMpJdr9odrs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQZagg1H7UD2YC5kNCYN1evjZS9rimpyHbZ9P9GGdosiF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

With this piece I had already drawing the face as a test for some pencil brushes I made in Procreate. I though it was to good not to use for anything, so I started to doodle around it, putting down random lines and squiggles like I so often do in the beginning of a piece. After a few tries and rejections, I started to find lines that spoke to me. \nAfter the piece progressed, I saw clearly this was a piece about information. It was actually a friend of mine that suggested the title, Mnemosyne, the Greek god of memory. That was it, this was Mnemosyne.\nMade in Procreate on iPad 12.9 with apple pencil and my own pencil brushes.\n\n\nAlways resting in an eternal flow of information\nshe is nowhere and everywhere\nalways collecting\nalways remembering\nalways absent \nAlways present\nMnemosyne is all\nMnemosyne is everyone", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY659VhvtEDMDRdFQYoyM4UgamnVhfrAFcZiVvpQd6U4k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaiS3gGm7rrrU3PHHFaqzKUp52trVyHutnd7f4xrmm7za", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY659VhvtEDMDRdFQYoyM4UgamnVhfrAFcZiVvpQd6U4k", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TW3YfKY44cS1uKEEfsnyuNFbkzydeayq9"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "ipad", "darkart", "painting", "drawing", "classic", "scifi", "fantasy", ""], "extra": {}}

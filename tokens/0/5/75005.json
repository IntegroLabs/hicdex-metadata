When asked about what the cover was (because he drew the little dude) he replied: \"It's just a guy troubled by circumstances. He's climbing up, just in case\" I've always felt like that little guy, and this is just a tribute. Gracias Flaco, sos eterno. Artwork by @luqispataro. 2008x2008, 15 editions.

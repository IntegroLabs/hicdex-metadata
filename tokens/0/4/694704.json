They were made as an exploration of the elusive form and materiality of digital space, but in subsequent times might present new interpretations.\n@__lindaloh__ ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaYcmnSbmrBTnWtgThWdeSmQsrA41HWMEro2fGzGEGrY2", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc7FsfDJAy6fk31G1v3g1sbjc6aLCJSguf8Mm9GppBnZ9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaYcmnSbmrBTnWtgThWdeSmQsrA41HWMEro2fGzGEGrY2", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hLuU2TXM1q1nfVLEiswv3Chi9XJnhbRoz"], "tags": ["abstract", "forest", "Finland", "MaxMSP", "contemporaryart", "digitalart", "nurb", "fineart", "videoart", "paint", "painting", "sublime", "colour", "color", "green", "red", "layers", "distortion", "elusive", "ephemeral", "materiality", "landscape", "light", "lindaloh", "LindaLoh", ""], "extra": {}}

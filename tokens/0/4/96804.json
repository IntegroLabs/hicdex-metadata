I took this photo on a 35mm analog camera and gave it a certain movement, reminiscent of the sea and its shells behind.  This island is a beatufiul and peacefull place to be, without access to cars, the only access is by boat. I miss traveling so much, it's one of my favourite things in life... I wish i could see the world again...","tags":["island","cave","cavern","travel","sea","view","beach","Brasil"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmRgo2wqojQUY5TiQ6xkqFZfbqvCRoh5B751Xew2he6pZc"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRgo2wqojQUY5TiQ6xkqFZfbqvCRoh5B751Xew2he6pZc","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

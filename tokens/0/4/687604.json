I feel like I'm becoming a better human...whatever that means. A little grayer around the face and a little wiser hopefully. I'm starting to see the nuances in various systems in society and within myself. I never want to be the person I was when I was a teenager or in my 20s or even in my 30s ever again. In my mid-40s I'm really starting to understand and adopt the concepts of patience and self-worth. Not sure why it's taken this long, but I suppose I never had this much time to think about life and art before. I REFUSE TO BE THE PERSON I USED TO BE, is a declarative work that sets a clear delineation of who I was, but leaves the future ambiguously open for new opportunities. The future me can have a myriad of options, but not any of the previous versions of myself over the years. For years, I've modeled my life on what NOT to do and who NOT to be like, but nothing about the person I truly wanted to be. I'm at the point in my life where I'm ready to be the person I've always been this entire time; me.

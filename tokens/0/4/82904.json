They're transferable – Unlike exchange-traded fungible tokens, NFTs are bought or sold on special marketplaces. However, their value depends on their uniqueness. 3. They're authentic – Blockchain technology powers non-fungible tokens. Therefore, you know that your NFT is genuine, since it’s nearly impossible to create counterfeits with a decentralized immutable ledger. 4. They preserve ownership rights – Again, this refers to an NFT’s use of decentralized platforms where no owner can alter the data once committed.","tags":["play","landscape","ai",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmdrjfp8FRbnULUoZygAjSekE9Nnjae1vcDbvgXdquFrAg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmdrjfp8FRbnULUoZygAjSekE9Nnjae1vcDbvgXdquFrAg","display_uri":"ipfs://QmcBDFhwMVLJEzzmc6ZMA9Swg9yL8Dy1EcErmJR4Gp4MCe","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

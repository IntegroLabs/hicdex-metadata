A total of 96,186 viral copies have been sent to as many wallets.\n\nWhether you believe horse paste is the cure or gas masks are the new normal, everyone has been affected by COVID-19. Now, even the blockchain itself is infected. It is still early in the disease process. Will you cure yourself of SARS-CoV-2 by burning this viral token in an act of communal catharsis? Will you choose to infect others? Or, will you risk the consequences of superinfection with an increasing viral load?\n\nLife is a terminal condition. Act appropriately.\n\n-\n\nSure, from a tezos wallet owner who shoots up Humira fortnightly - go take your fear and burn it!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf9eAdxe5zvSoCDWHVvQUwFk4xGPSGs6EhZYfehQnT46c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNfkijQfGxNdwsd5XkW5S2XmVYwaJgbqzCxa3ydV66pdP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf9eAdxe5zvSoCDWHVvQUwFk4xGPSGs6EhZYfehQnT46c", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XZaBDNay5tghpwCLvwY3mx5yjAsH95TmD"], "tags": ["Horse", "Paste", "Is", "The", "Cure"], "extra": {}}

These NFTs are not for sale to the public.\n\nEach month will have a different edition depending on how many people fit into the categories (see tweet). 1 person will only receive 1 collectors' only NFT.\n\n\nWhat you can do with this NFT:\n\n- Keep it as a part of your NFT collection.\n\n- Sell it according to your price.\n\n- Collect all 13 of collectors' only NFTs (February 2022 - February 2023).\nThose who can collect it and inform us can ask to upgrade to an exclusive NFT (more detail about it will be announced on 1st January 2023).\n\n\nThank you for the support and attention! Happy collecting :)\n\n\nFor more info, read this tweet:\nhttps://twitter.com/196PixelsLight/status/1497264185373122566?s=20&t=FTYWJHvWjUgb7Q6GKODA6w\n\nOriginal art and animation by 196 Pixels Light\nMusic by LuxirusVein", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRRG6gaymB6bERH6K31c8oFYrtRdaCvTKgabFctEkD1zN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZLUHsJuKEA4pBLsiwM93Paw73GKJaRb6zfRVaZ92BVAb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRRG6gaymB6bERH6K31c8oFYrtRdaCvTKgabFctEkD1zN", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gSWWA2CGgEu5HysGB6NU3bffTE5mG3j4r"], "tags": ["cozyroom", "music", "pixelart", "196pixelslight", "pixel", "card", "collectible"], "extra": {}}

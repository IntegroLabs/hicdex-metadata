Those are my starting point to do NFT charity, therefore, profit from any purchased artworks in this collection will go to small animal hospitals where provide veterinary services for stray cats and stray dogs in Thailand. I would like to thank you earlier for all of my future collectors who come and support my dream project. You can check my transparent processes and charity documents directly on my twitter account, \"@RBNeallaen\". Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

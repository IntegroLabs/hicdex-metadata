Every small particular act changes something of the social. With this argument he was sympathizing with Marxism, which was critical of this existentialism, accusing it of individualism. It was time to combine individual freedom with collective freedom. But knowing our society, could we be individually free in a free society? In my opinion, human beings are too similar to be able to do so without conflict, too many egos and looks. Is it too soon to say that \"Hell is other people\"? In any case, we are responsible for others, and in the end, we are so responsible for our own men that anguish is born in us. Because as I was saying, we are condemned to be free, we are condemned to choose continuously, even if we do not choose, we are not only deciding not to do it, but we are letting others decide for us, giving them part of our right and identity and they are the ones who begin to make us and not us.","tags":["0xLxxl","Absurdism","Thoughts"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmSXHa28wjjjbE3tcZq5zkcFhsZwwZRfSMCJaqB4p1jyDx","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSXHa28wjjjbE3tcZq5zkcFhsZwwZRfSMCJaqB4p1jyDx","display_uri":"ipfs://QmYuoRPMVJH1DvQ2MwF34K2d1fu5nJFgcKfBxc4KNYsFTQ","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

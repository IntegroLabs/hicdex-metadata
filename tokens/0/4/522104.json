{"__version": 1, "token_id": 522104, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Poisson", "description": "Here each material acts like a unique color of electric charge, with a field spreads out by iterative solution of the Poisson equation. The result is that even though affinities are computed entirely locally (no neighborhoods), in principle the interactions between material in the system can extend to infinite range (although there's a finite 'light speed'). The result has some similarities to the large-neighborhood experiment, but achieves multiple different scales of organization on its own rather than needing to have a hierarchy of scales put in by hand. / @ngutten\n\n2560 x 1440 mp4\n11/9/21\nNicholas Guttenberg", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNVbnpZo3bk1XVCmtizsHUD4XBQb1ik3tXcLZ5WsCCFua", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWsuQntyLCgAgBhdaDwBtJruXwrxn74Ta6DrDQhU15rjb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNVbnpZo3bk1XVCmtizsHUD4XBQb1ik3tXcLZ5WsCCFua", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SWsPUdLvr4KCuZxN69ju2bZruggLbYhjx"], "tags": ["video", "simulation", "generative", "gliders", "cellularautomaton"], "extra": {}}

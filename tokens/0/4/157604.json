Cairn is a virtually generated installation created by British digital artist Nicholas Delap @ndelap and exists as a mediation of the mystical qualities of British Folklore and history by seeking to provide new digital realities and alter the viewer\u2019s perspectives of the natural. Built in Blender and installed in Unity, the work was made using a combination of digital media including 3D scanning, 3d modelling, and creative coding. This NFT is a looping video clip, with audio, captured within the virtual installation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY64zymFi7SKCpx3UGCKP2t8qUHRMpYvuh9eawdkxVujW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZxQ3QCAyLq3vBjG4K9NHvuuMhhRo69jd939fvB4SpZoD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY64zymFi7SKCpx3UGCKP2t8qUHRMpYvuh9eawdkxVujW", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1Q4ZBCnpfba5A8TWLReYBF6NUbPnFLAFRH"], "tags": ["Cairn", "nicholasDelap", "Ndelap", "digitalart", "cgi", "3dscanning", "virtualworld", "environment", "ancient", "dolmen", "celtic", "british", "wilderness"], "extra": {}}

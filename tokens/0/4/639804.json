One of the best lines from that show that resonates with me was, \"YOU'RE BOOS MEAN NOTHING, I'VE SEEN WHAT YOU CHEER FOR.\" from Season 4: Episode 3 'One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty'. (That's great Andrew, but why put a quote from an animated show and then change it?) The answer is simple, to all the haters of my work this one is dedicated to you. I switched up up the quote a little to be a little more inviting to the haters of the world. The boos already mean absolutely nothing, why not welcome them and show compassion to them? Usually the haters will have zero followers, their account is private, almost always a white guy and oh usually wearing sunglasses in his profile pic so no one can fully make out who they are. There are a lot of sad people out there with WAY too much time on their hands to just sit around and spew hate to those they don't like or care for. I personally won't engage you in a heated one-sided diatribe, but I acknowledge your pain and suffering; you're better than your worst instincts.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYgTshLAGdo18ygqCtjynPZqxZUBfzUmQNTxij6cfKHBq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPtK7sZmb91x6xQ4Xxzc7FWcKMf3vmYGgr8FSQtDNg3Jr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYgTshLAGdo18ygqCtjynPZqxZUBfzUmQNTxij6cfKHBq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

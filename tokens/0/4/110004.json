Right in the middle of Chinatown, this side street is cramped, even by NYC standards. But that's its appeal. Entering it, you're engulfed, both physically by the buildings surrounding it, and in the atmosphere it creates. Tucked inside is a famous noodle shop, a trendy restaurant, and holdover businesses that've been there forever, trying to hang on in an ever changing city.

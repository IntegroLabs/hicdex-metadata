It is a photo mosaic of almost all of the photographs I have taken with this camera since I recieved it from my Mum in 2016 whilst I was in India. This camera has meant a lot to me, and is where I developed and found my love for photography and the documentation of the world we live in. | ~19000 images 11547x866px | Canon 400D, Lightroom, and AdreaMosaic | Photographed from 27/05/2106 - 16/06/2021 |", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmahyFGtgY7TP1teBiV2iJEJRpssLys68bGpPFQtVZ4X2D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPRjMeDEAbf1c78aVqGLKPXCqT7hgoGjzaNqfghGmVhC1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmahyFGtgY7TP1teBiV2iJEJRpssLys68bGpPFQtVZ4X2D", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1T9mwfpXQJqb5LJ2CZ6sd69K9vyo6xEPLW"], "tags": ["Memoriam", "Canon400D", "19000", "HENthousand", "photography", "photographicmosaic"], "extra": {}}

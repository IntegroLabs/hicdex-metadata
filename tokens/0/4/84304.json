Created by international bestselling poet and new media artist, Iain S. Thomas (pleasefindthis) and animated by Andreion De Castro. Using the two surviving poems of Sappho, GPT-3 was prompted using the fragments of sentences that have survived the last 1500 years. The initial text in the animation is by Sappho, the bold text is by GPT-3. These are the lost poems of Sappho. Pricing is in tranches with a maximum of 40 editions - The first five are five tezos, the last five are 1200: 5 - 5, 5 - 10, 5 - 30,  5- 90, 5- 150, 5 - 300, 5- 600, 5 - 1200. Proceeds will go towards realising a publication of the entire work, with wallet addresses of purchasers preserved and used as a design element within the interior of the publication.

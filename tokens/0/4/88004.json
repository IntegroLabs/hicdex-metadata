Scanned by Tom Burtonwood using Infrared 3d scanner and rendered in Blender. The Autoprogettazione chair is part of a series  of open source furniture conceived by the late designer Enzo Mari and intended  to be built easily with simple slats of wood, a hammer and nails. This chair is still in service today in our studio. https://self-assembly.org/library/","tags":["Autoprogettazione","EnzoMari","ChicagoDesignMuseum","opensource","render","3dscan"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmU13KhdUqWPGM5dXojbBTkD9A2PuNwvUuRdxyZNHyQhR5"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmU13KhdUqWPGM5dXojbBTkD9A2PuNwvUuRdxyZNHyQhR5","display_uri":"ipfs://QmeuYY6yonFPZKCvYikyYswhpoouSSdx78BNiti9JqMt8M","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

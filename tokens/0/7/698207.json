I really enjoyed watching it, because there was a very funny mike. I really like when he sings and holds the mic, behind his silliness he is very good. My mother then showed me a picture of Moncter Inc for me to draw. When finished I added the mic in Mike's hand, and said that the monsters would go sing with Mike.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY2PNgRg1TPKMsy6XtR2M6EHNvcZu9726FkDske13XJwQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPrb5Gy3JTfXoKDKmJSgXPf21Juhc9MWtFzYCcHL8zFPo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY2PNgRg1TPKMsy6XtR2M6EHNvcZu9726FkDske13XJwQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2DRKP5SP3pJADvpFUaostkqkRxA2zAzJ2h"], "tags": ["kids", "animation", "monster", "monsterinc", "youngartist", "5yearsold", "illustration"], "extra": {}}

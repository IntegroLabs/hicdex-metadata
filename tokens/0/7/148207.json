A parade of galaxies and stars encompassed the world and in the midst of it all the Moon got dislodged and fell on the middle of a lonesome road. No one heard her, not even the trees, for its decent was silent and elegant like that of a feather in a windless day. The hours tiptoed by, and a man stumbled upon the Moon. He came to a halt and smiled at the sight of it all. He was a wanderer searching for an answer, an answer he knew awaited at the end of that road, where the edge of the world overlooks an abyss. 'Another stone on the road,' he thought, 'One last thing to overcome.' And yet he stood still, imprisoned by the lights and the caresses of the wind. He drew a deep breath and looked back to the path he had walked. Perhaps he had been wrong. Perhaps, the answer didn't rest at the end of that road. He blinked. The Moon faded, the stars and galaxies returned to where they belonged. He looked at the road ahead, and found void instead. His heart skipped a beat. His eyes darted to his feet; to the edge of the cliff. He took a step back and turned his back to the end of the world. Perhaps it wasn't just another stone on the road.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQetkkYuapESJa5RbW1G2JLGvEW9zhJQyndgiYCH3M9b4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaMToyzQNsePZ6tPN6jbP3pj18NJeJYUcW3N17Xc8Y872", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQetkkYuapESJa5RbW1G2JLGvEW9zhJQyndgiYCH3M9b4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PT7QokcTFdBZRaDbxogxJ6tUnQtJ4sLW7"], "tags": ["moonphotomanipulationroadabyssendfantasyglowspacecomposition"], "extra": {}}

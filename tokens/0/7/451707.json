They blocked the DOS Punks creator on Twitter and also brought down the website with the above image listed on the landing page (http://vectorpoem.com/playscii/). This event sparked a Twitter debate on open-source software's legal usage under the MIT license. \n\nIn response to this spark, @playscii twitter account started blocking followers' accounts which are tagging them. This event has created a history that is now going to rest on the Tezos blockchain. \n\nHere is the community forked version after this event -> https://github.com/squintdev/nftscii\n\nTweet that started this debate -> https://twitter.com/maxcapacity/status/1449888701073399810", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ6xJJGHPUtcvhks4MvfaRSfTMkrPwTuaYKoSeGD7wdDT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQzTW3o6b8ogAQVRu6B9Fa5WARmjd1AQMEd3uXvrC4tpj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ6xJJGHPUtcvhks4MvfaRSfTMkrPwTuaYKoSeGD7wdDT", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1byMoG1FNtswJtzsAbmKzK8ARSWVdtcqa1"], "tags": ["playsciiopen-sourcemaxcapacitydos-punkstwitter"], "extra": {}}

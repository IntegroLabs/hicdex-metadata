The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: I\u2019ve made it to a field and am now in the POV of a combat zone. A mortar team is lobbing mortar shells. I have no use for them. In fact, I have a combat present for one who doesn\u2019t :) I sling two scopes at the enemy. One is 100m away and fires 25mm steel projectiles. The other, 1000m away, hurls indistinguishable multicoloured plastic projectiles. There is no tactical value to either projectile. There is a cost to firing them both at the same time. I yell at the top of my voice to designate a target and for the other to aim. The sound of the projectiles slamming into the ground echoes off twilights thick before them. I yell at the other man for wasting fire power.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 96 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZEmaeQpCQC7sSxsvFAVRCXy9AHwzNWD3VW3Qr2x7K4sd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRRwfJ5mfdhwiysDBxEoBhQ5y8f7mHDDyCcVFvSZJ12vB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZEmaeQpCQC7sSxsvFAVRCXy9AHwzNWD3VW3Qr2x7K4sd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}

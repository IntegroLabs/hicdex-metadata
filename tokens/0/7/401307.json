While the concept of the series is to increase awareness to the disturbing status of the Monarch Butterfly, reflections of its amazing migration reveals the power of \"generational perseverance\". The Monarch Butterfly is one of North America\u2019s most phenomenal species. As the only butterfly known to make the transcontinental migration, the Monarch Butterfly will be migrating from September to October in order to arrive at their \"wintering\" sites in November.  Monarch Butterflies encounter various challenges on the annual migration\u2026 strong winds can blow them off course... rain and/or cold temperatures can slow them down... the lack of energy-producing nectar sources and parasitic diseases may lead to death as well as collisions with humans and their vehicles. While No individual Monarch Butterfly completes the round-trip journey, it may take from three to four generations to complete the transcontinental migration. Indeed a journey only completed through the generational perseverance of the delicate but yet phenomenal Monarch Butterfly.

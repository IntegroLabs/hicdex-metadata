We can create a dual word pyramid within it and because of the structure of the syntax crystal that is formed we can repeat and invert it to fit perfectly intertwined into the first word. The result is a unique crystal that takes on an almost 3 dimensional and sculptural quality to it. Every syntax crystal is unique to the properties of the letters, words, and possibilities within. Subsequently, could there be a narrative in this crystal? If there was, it would definitely be an abstract, bordering on the absurd. That isn't the point, at least not in this case. The purpose is to locate these gems and harken them into existence.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRgyGJ5EiAGQnonv1h5mbZiypnLJ3pAG5Mvh1nwoqTRJE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRDxgmREKzFsEQBsdtJM32ufRht58kCGyhmn6tPVWPbwX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRgyGJ5EiAGQnonv1h5mbZiypnLJ3pAG5Mvh1nwoqTRJE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

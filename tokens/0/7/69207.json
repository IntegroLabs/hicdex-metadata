The seed points are those that enter cycles under the orbit function within 16,384 steps. You can actually stare at a point watch it go through its entire cycle (although there are many exclusive cycles, so a single point will not traverse the entire image). The polar distortion for this object is (r^(-3.8), θ*0.95 φ*1.02). @BruceKnowsHow","tags":["Generative","Abstract","Render","3D","Fractal","Loop","Procedural","Video"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmWKNvM6mmp2JWJqsLr65DtLPZvKbW24q6LTQ3Jgan7rRp"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWKNvM6mmp2JWJqsLr65DtLPZvKbW24q6LTQ3Jgan7rRp","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

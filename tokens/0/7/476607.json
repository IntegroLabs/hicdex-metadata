As one of the main figures in the Cuban Revolution, his face has become a symbol of resistance in the counter-cultural movement and in popular culture.[3]\n\nWhile still a medical student, Guevara traveled across South America and was radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease he had witnessed with his own eyes.[4] He was so eager to stop the exploitation of what he said was carried out by the \"capitalists of the United States\", so he tried to help the social reforms launched in Guatemala by President Jacobo rbenz. However, rbenz was later ousted with the help of the CIA at the urging of the United Fruit Company, so Guevara became increasingly firm with his ideology.[4] After that, he moved to Mexico City, where he met Ra\u00fal and Fidel Castro and joined the 26 July Movement. They sailed to Cuba on a yacht called the Granma, with the aim of overthrowing the US-backed Cuban dictator, Fulgencio Batista.[5] Guevara later became a well-known figure among the rebels and was appointed second in command, and he himself also played an important role in the two-year guerrilla campaign that eventually overthrew the Batista regime.[6]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNMKNDq7Uy7tGABz4a4fQ5RSPQCEz9kxrJj5ttgKcyk37", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcLVaFEUkqiRei7DJY8oBK7wZHXeFMeVaL31mPPYUC93j", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNMKNDq7Uy7tGABz4a4fQ5RSPQCEz9kxrJj5ttgKcyk37", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Wq3y931pnt6zsBq6XHy7eqzLM3WTsKA3D"], "tags": ["cheguevara", "abstract", "basquiat", "sureal", "skull", "animated", "realistic"], "extra": {}}

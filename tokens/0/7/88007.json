Edition of 3/3 - Original .jpg file 30x30. Description: “15 minutes of fame” is an NFT collection of 25 influencers portraits, mainly working in the art world.  Common but famous people living in Andy Warhol’s prophecy  of the “15 minutes of fame”.  The series is not intended as a glorifying of instagram famous people nor a party organised by the Factory with a photo booth where you’re invited to wear a wig.  It’s more a critic of the capitalistic, democratic and post pop society were conformism and mediocrity are the key to succeed and everything is filtered by an instagram lens. ","tags":["hansulrichobrist","saulzanolari","digitalart","cryptoart","popart","andywarhol"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmbCL6xduGPTzU1vQf4V5VoVzVyKvzTG95ioZKjZ52c1hH"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbCL6xduGPTzU1vQf4V5VoVzVyKvzTG95ioZKjZ52c1hH","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Taking a single day hiatus on my toy collection to create another tribute piece honoring a few different things. First off I am a huge Tezos supporter and will always advocate for its platforms and artists. 2nd, this piece is dedicated to a new collector and friend who found my collection quite randomly but we connected immediately \u2014 and he is an active member in the Gevol community so shout out to them as well! And lastly this is a blatant dig at all those people that use the \"Right Click Save\" statement concerning the value and sole existence of NFTs. Sure you can look at all the amazing art we own and make, but only the people that care about supporting the artists and community know and FEEL its real value.

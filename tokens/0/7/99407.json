There was dark inside and smelled like hay. Through some holes in the roof, the light came inside. I was hidden from the rest of the world in this building. Time became slow and dense. I was feeling the time at the fingertips. In my mind surfaced memories from my childhood where I climbed a shed in the summer. The air was so dense, that it could be taken in a handful. At the end of the long roof was a small window, which opened a view on the garden. Everything seemed so bright through that window. It was like another world. Empty world, that waiting on you. And you, sitting quietly in the dark and just watching.","tags":["Colourful","Summer","Bright","Colors","Memories","Drawing","Expressionism","Painting","Abstract","Bohdansvyrydov"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmVdpYPqoAez6gbGE2429F3MzjNXcsdNZtya2sKWfrbtG4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVdpYPqoAez6gbGE2429F3MzjNXcsdNZtya2sKWfrbtG4","display_uri":"ipfs://QmQyYmwTwNZkg6fQ2zwgGs5qCPRxfTiLJs9MKqAEUudbn9","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

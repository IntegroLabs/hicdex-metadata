The Safe Zone is driven out from the dark era of the artistâ€™s life when he was struggling with the addiction problem. A passive period that isolated the artist in his safe corner, a period that was just a consumption, without any action.  This lived experience was an inspiration for the artist to extend his encounter toward the world, to a large part of contemporary societies. Societies that do not act, have no action and only consume in their safe zone, in corners of their home.","tags":["digitalpainting","figurative","darkart","creepy"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmR1uKLYCTeWPsjenTHPUDoqaeDZdSmJotpuXuZM4zJSxj"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmR1uKLYCTeWPsjenTHPUDoqaeDZdSmJotpuXuZM4zJSxj","display_uri":"ipfs://QmW3ty4vMt2Kp1UKEdybdoPgVkwc6QxYekMsqUDfjPjbHH","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

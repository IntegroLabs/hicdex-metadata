The Sentinels were facing a hard way to find some clues where we could mine the crystal even though we got some help from our best friend, Crocky. The crystal was named Matahari, some of you might already be familiar with, it's a tiny fragment caused by a big explosion from the sun itself. Yes, your civilization is already extinct here, but \u201cthere\u201d you are still alive! Wonderful isn't it? It's hard to explain, let's make it simple then. Technically, we are just existing in the same block universe where past, present, and future all exist and are all equally \u201creal\u201d. We won't do any harm to your source of energy, but somehow we got a feeling that your sun, Matahari, might have another form hidden in plain sight of every single of us, and it can be dangerous if left in that form.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme1ocktz5e7KN1oqmdyWbVMSWY6AuH685p1BXt4jHGP1x", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmeo3dpFVhChPoATmxnmZu8kcYGjrofLNrMV9dzASqXpnY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme1ocktz5e7KN1oqmdyWbVMSWY6AuH685p1BXt4jHGP1x", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bdfs8hh17RYPZpTUxKGsFuM9Xhu2GRvnR"], "tags": ["SantuariStudio", "Loreng", "CAWA", "CryptoArtWeekAsia", "Sentinel", "Asia", "Indonesia"], "extra": {}}

Both are not wearing uniforms though. When we asked why their clothes are soaking wet, they said that they had to cross 3 rivers and a mountain and then finally walk for almost 2 hrs just to be able to attend their school. That's when they confirmed that when they left home, they were actually in their school uniforms but they got drenched so they had to change. \n\nMaking education accessible to all is still a challenge. How lucky are we to be able to go to school without having to worry about the physical distance and danger of the possibility of getting drowned like these 2 kids? For us who are in the different side of the coin, who are we to complain?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSTWp8MxXeJrKrtraCKUQgda3ACQeir9Rj164Psu5rJP4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSTWp8MxXeJrKrtraCKUQgda3ACQeir9Rj164Psu5rJP4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmSTWp8MxXeJrKrtraCKUQgda3ACQeir9Rj164Psu5rJP4", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSTWp8MxXeJrKrtraCKUQgda3ACQeir9Rj164Psu5rJP4", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1TdLBp7vx1LWus9bXQBiUuU2stDku6Zrn8"], "tags": ["Student", "illustration", "sunlight", "ray", "drawing", "forest", "philippines."], "extra": {}}

Let's have fun! \n\nFirst appearance: Free Comic Book Day: The Amazing Spider-Man #1 (May 2007)\nMister Negative came into conflict with Spider-Man when he made a power play to take control of New York's criminal underworld, attempting to wipe out all existing members of the Karnelli and Maggia crime families using a specific DNA bio-weapon called the \"Devil's Breath.\"\nAs a result of his exposure to the D-Lite drug, Mister Negative can generate and control Darkforce and Lightforce, manifesting it as the photographic negative of black or white electrical energy. He uses this unique form of Darkforce for a variety of purposes.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8JVzDzEELBxQi7z4Dhn1TeE1yDDHPn4hS875BSRo2rL", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8JVzDzEELBxQi7z4Dhn1TeE1yDDHPn4hS875BSRo2rL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb8JVzDzEELBxQi7z4Dhn1TeE1yDDHPn4hS875BSRo2rL", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1gE7i3NjxuS65bGcVjBpmoMidjyy2xPR9S"], "tags": ["pixelart", "ascii", "gifart", "card", "tribute", "roboto", "xeldajara", "nft", "cryptoart", "artcollectible", "villains", "superheroes", "robot", "fun"], "extra": {}}

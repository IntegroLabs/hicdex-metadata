{"__version": 1, "token_id": 699703, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Grave Worms", "description": "Grave Worms are carrion feeders that are usually found feasting on the decomposing corpses of those who have died early, violent deaths. Sustaining themselves on both the decaying biological matter as well as the negative energy imbued within, these creatures are a natural part of the cycle of life and death.\n\nHarvested by magic users usually after a fresh feeding or during the month of the Worm Moon, these worms can be used to harness the negative energy for spellcasting. Used to both harm others as well as to create protective wards, these flesh-eating creatures are a helpful tool in any magic-user's cauldron. \n\n~~~~~~\nThis NFT has unannounced utility prior to the public launch of The Cult & The Coven game. \n\nPost-launch, this utility will no longer be in effect.

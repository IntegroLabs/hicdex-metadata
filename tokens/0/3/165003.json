They look like a crown!\u201d They all looked around with a deep clenching frown: \u201cA crown you see? Looks like a trap! A pit where you\u2019d fall and immediately drown\u201d. \nThe meaning of stars is hard to decipher: where one sees rope another sees viper. Be lighter! Remember the masters! But that was their truth and you are not made of plaster. What a disaster would be if your tears, or sweat, or blood, corroded your skin. Say bye to the old days where you had to say: \"If people can\u2019t love me, I'll have them afraid\". Or shame! In place to refrain! While deep in your heart you are going insane. All of those thoughts you were taught to betray, to wish them away, obey! Always obey la ley. \u201cFuck it today! Come the astray, the broken and lame, the ones who were taught that they were not okay. We are here to remain so let\u2019s make one thing clear: we are here. We won\u2019t disappear\u201d.\n---\nBacanal Rave, a reinterpretation of Ricci's \"Bacchus and Ariadne\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZiqd7s35QVoaCnPZjMzQKmuK7vtRScgqvLTSykrxhk5F", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNthvjiXER5Ue1EwKatsecqmtb5SMbcwesBY3g5yiZQZ5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZiqd7s35QVoaCnPZjMzQKmuK7vtRScgqvLTSykrxhk5F", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aQKoJYGJTZRNDjunJVuPmJeZPKsrRvpBZ"], "tags": ["blender", "3d", "story", "illustration", "mythology", "color"], "extra": {}}

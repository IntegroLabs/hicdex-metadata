I was probably around 13 years old when I got my first stereo for Christmas and of course it had a CD PLAYER! I got 1 CD, \"No Need To Argue\" by The Cranberries. I really like the song \"Zombie\" and from there I just wanted everything. So what did we all do back then?? We signed up for BMG Music Service or Columbia House and got a grip load of discs for like a penny with an obligation to buy additional music for full price. Thing was, they couldn't enforce that stuff because I was 13 so every time they sent one of those unsolicited albums I would just send it back, over and over again. I'm still unsure of what became of my numerous delinquent accounts, but I do know I filled out the majority of my music collection as an early teen on the backs of these bargain CD offers that were incredibly popular in the 90s.

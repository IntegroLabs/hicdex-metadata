He was PURE LOVE. Never hissed, never scratched. Only meowed to tell me his food/water/litter needed attention. He loved belly rubs, cuddles, sitting and laying belly up in the sun. Always happy. Always loving. The minting of this NFT is to memorialize his spirit. To spread fragments of his unconditional love around the globe. Rest in peace Maestro.

The bridges were too low for the buses to pass under, cutting off the whole area from the poor who relied on public transport to travel.\n\n\u201cClass war at the level of built environment\u201d \u2014 Mike Davis\n\nBy Tomas Tvarijonas\n1080\u200a\u00d71080 pixels", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8Fd2AVpfBXYrXQ9obRpVBfGz7avik2zHTGLbrfQxmDq", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8Fd2AVpfBXYrXQ9obRpVBfGz7avik2zHTGLbrfQxmDq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb8Fd2AVpfBXYrXQ9obRpVBfGz7avik2zHTGLbrfQxmDq", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1agdKkU8dhnJ9rVEGZrfV7oNeAELokcdSb"], "tags": ["architecture", "hostilearchitecture", "newyork", "design", "drawing", "linedrawing", "illustration", "RobertMoses"], "extra": {}}

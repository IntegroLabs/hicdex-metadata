Other than the saint and the fiend there were the genies, created from light. They lived freely on earth, even the bridge between the earth and the sky was widely opened for them. And for them, ther were no specific responsibilities other than pray and praise to the creator.\n\nInstead of caretaking the earth, they damaged the earth, they harmed it, and even murdered each other, and this particular part of land is where they fought. They couldn't resist the temptation of their greed nor their consciouseness, and these are what is left from that day, as if the land itself tells a story.\n\nBut on the other hand, the man and the woman learned their mistake, this time they overcome the temptation. They took the courage and keep moving forward towards the guidance that they have faith in.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTzbs4K6BBvFuyme8ZtYuCajhntsPwux7Ew2LuNvX9oJu", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc3MXefhdFCdaYxdw4aZTDQYNeSkjPcixf7smhxg7U3yg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTzbs4K6BBvFuyme8ZtYuCajhntsPwux7Ew2LuNvX9oJu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hWE2N4qbNopZcKHhAofbcSAQrt87dbYQJ"], "tags": ["Adam", "Eve", "Skull", "Skeleton", "3D", "3DArt", "VisualArt", "History"], "extra": {}}

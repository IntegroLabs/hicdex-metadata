The photos play with the idea that it takes very little to radically shift our perceptions, and that it is worth exploring this phenomenon.","tags":["photography","nature","abstract","digital","red","yellow","orange","color","photo","ambient","fineart","surreal","alien","liminal"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmYgs1QS8daaqp47p5KMh6GzafRzBSH7v7qZRbbkc7pWFS"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYgs1QS8daaqp47p5KMh6GzafRzBSH7v7qZRbbkc7pWFS","display_uri":"ipfs://QmYRdJ19ED9epo6xWWuD39ZK7fhzWZGd6zeZ7ir9DF5wZy","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

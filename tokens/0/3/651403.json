In the age of COVID, we live lonely lives to a certain extent or another. We're disconnected and yet, ironically connected via the internet. As a consequence, in this new virtual reality is projecting versions of ourselves onto the world. How do we navigate this new paradigm of existence and live full and productive lives? How do we create real meaningful relationships with people if we cannot be in close proximity of each other? Better question would be, how are children adapting to living lonely? If observing my nieces and nephews is any indication, we're in big trouble. Children and younger people of today are completely absorbed with their smartphones, tablets, video games, etc. The line between actual reality and the virtual for them is close to blurred. The friends, conversations, and experiences they have are collectively online. We're all living through this experience together in our own way. Living during COVID doesn't have to be lonely...reach out and make a call, send a txt, use FaceTime, send an email, and/or write a letter and mail it to someone; we're all we have in this world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPMGVtsf3EXmz3EQvuNJVdtE4d1y58GJDprNpqBShaiHg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTrpH2P8eUe5qbW7MusXJR3PsdUoSCHzr5bgvJ7u5Te2c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPMGVtsf3EXmz3EQvuNJVdtE4d1y58GJDprNpqBShaiHg", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

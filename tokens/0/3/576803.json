{"__version": 1, "token_id": 576803, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Tribute to Grampy", "description": "Grampy is the only grandpa I have left in this world and he is losing me before I am losing him. He was always a man of few words, but now with his stroke and dementia that the family suspects is now Alzheimer's, I only get \"hey sweetie, how are ya?\" His memory is dwindling down fast and is forgetting family members like my sibling. He has three children and forgot which child was born first. So I made this art piece to say that I will be the keeper of our memories. From top to bottom: the birdhouse we made together that has been a home for many birds. The home that my father grew up in and has been standing strong for decades. The lobster traps - a staple of Grampy's lifetime home, Maine, where he moved to in childhood from French Canada. Lastly, a photo of us, where I am fading away because his memory of me is fading. In the hospital after he had his stroke he looked at me with tears in his eyes and he said \"I love you\" over and over again. I will never forget this intimate moment - I've never had a moment like that with anyone and I will always cherish our time together. The camping, fishing, and snow mobile rides. The raspberry picking. The quiet winter nights. The loud snoring naps. All of it. I love you too, Grampy.

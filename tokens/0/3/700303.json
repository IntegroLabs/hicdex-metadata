Many songbirds have been classified as \"endangered\" or \"high risk for extinction\" due to the increase in nest predation and invasive species as well as disappearing habitats through deforestation. The image was created with the assistance of artificial intelligence, VQGAN+CLIP (machine learning algorithms), and text prompts. It may be interpreted differently through the eyes and imagination of the viewers.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUEkJ7suL8hw5h2sw6ptyuHdsQeSKqxsEp647bY2KNHtY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUEkJ7suL8hw5h2sw6ptyuHdsQeSKqxsEp647bY2KNHtY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUEkJ7suL8hw5h2sw6ptyuHdsQeSKqxsEp647bY2KNHtY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XQeAkWGur8esmmuChxBN5VTZk4X3Z48gH"], "tags": ["songbirds", "trees", "nature", "deforestation", "endangered", "flying", "rainforest", "forest", "birds", "invasive", "habitat", "predation"], "extra": {}}

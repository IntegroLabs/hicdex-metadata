In 1500 initiated a forced colonization and a massacre of local inhabitants. The traces of this violence are still in our society. Just look at some of Brazilians eyes and you will see a captive. But shhh the colonizer doesn't want you to see our identity. For them we are all the same. Are we? This work is a overlaping of indigenous paintings from de XV and XVI century.

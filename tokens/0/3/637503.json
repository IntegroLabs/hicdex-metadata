We are hoping to raise enough money for 1 year of her therapy needs.  \n\nVeronica has struggled with mental health issues for decades and she has finally found a therapist to help her. However, her therapist left Tompkins County Mental Health (where she gets support every day) in December to go into private practice. Her therapist doesn't accept Medicare. Unfortunately, any insurance she can get in our area is more expensive than paying direct. \n\nVeronica is BIPOC queer artist, poet, and community activist. She is also an nft poetry artist that goes by the pseudonym _v. Her poetry can be found on my other NFTs.  \n\n\"But, despite the last few days of struggle, \nI am not poor in hope.\nI believe help will come.\" \n_v\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUiQjdQr4EpWcMbk9Qe2x18tV9oFrRo1yjqmcPzmi3nJV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUiQjdQr4EpWcMbk9Qe2x18tV9oFrRo1yjqmcPzmi3nJV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUiQjdQr4EpWcMbk9Qe2x18tV9oFrRo1yjqmcPzmi3nJV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1X4WnytvFw9QyLy8QyQycWg3t9JWjMez74"], "tags": ["photography", "mentalhealth", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}

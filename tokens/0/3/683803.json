Where it can be a double-edged sword for the humans around him by bringing chaos and turning their ambitious self into an obsessive person.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYYG3CyDM9GVnaY7Qb4GbqH6XWnC7PwxngeUEz48W3SUJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTF8Srxs68ne8ZQFmrwAP9NwcNo7ZFoGiGD9okK1iDsJV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYYG3CyDM9GVnaY7Qb4GbqH6XWnC7PwxngeUEz48W3SUJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2JUZqAFa1yT7CugrxhdPGj42cGgjFFQvW4"], "tags": ["cyber", "cyberpunk", "oni", "demon", "japan", "japanese", "evil", "samurai", "skull", "flower", "cyborg", "robot"], "extra": {}}

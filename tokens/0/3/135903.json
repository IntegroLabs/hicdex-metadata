Analysis of the solution structure of RNase Sa.", "description": "Thesis Series Part 3/3 - Finally, we have the beginning of the end. This is the last of my thesis papers, and the most computational of all of them. Before this project, I was not a programmer. After it, I was (now I look back on that code and feel embarrassed by how inefficient it is haha). It was also my first taste of releasing open-source code, something I really strongly believe in still today. This project was about making a tool to compare multiple models of a protein structure simultaneously. Proteins are dynamic, they're flexible, and they don't exist as frozen snapshots the way we visualize them. Most people would try to compare average structures, but that makes no sense. The average position of a drawbridge is a state it almost never actually exists in. This one is from my paper: \"Ensemblator v3: Robust atom-level comparative analyses and classification of protein structure ensembles\" doi: 10.1002/pro.3249", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYoE3Ls2Q1pHczy55nMoNMboUq2zk6f41wY6M8s3trbAD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbZRwFdCPSkoMs3fCmbEwkn65BzXyZBVSE3vSAn2GjyEm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYoE3Ls2Q1pHczy55nMoNMboUq2zk6f41wY6M8s3trbAD", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZBMhTa7gxSpaeXoqyc6bTCrxEHfZYSpPt"], "tags": ["science", "proteins", "ensemblator"], "extra": {}}

Most living beings are just trying to survive, thrive and reproduce. With this perceived truth in our minds, we can create the anagram narrative you seen on the other page: EXISTENCE / ENTICE SEX. This is the hetero-normative way of existence. On a very fundamental, almost reptilian brain level, we're here to make more of us and spread like a virus around the world. We're pretty successful in that venture, but man do we suck at living and organizing ourselves. I keep saying this, but I'm so looking forward to when a Super AI becomes sentient. Either it's going to help us live better or ummm have you seen The Terminator movies? I'm banking that it's the prior rather than the latter.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTXiJdHwBKU9JQVEfzZ5ex7hgA3KDnofYjpNZ15jVbq7g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP3xwFQmNj2aAMCPP3eQfb4UnUvhtoxTVEkZ6Ur5rSA19", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTXiJdHwBKU9JQVEfzZ5ex7hgA3KDnofYjpNZ15jVbq7g", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

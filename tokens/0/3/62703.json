Color saturation with black works similarly on paper and screens, thus facilitating a perception that is almost equal between a live and digital spectator.   Referencing Sol LeWitt, this particular piece comes with a set of instructions in order to re-translate it into a physical object. The piece is then meant to be exhibited both ways.","tags":["meta","morph","conceptual","lines","analogue","digital","drawing"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmZ4sUABus9MRL63tqgKHv3Tb2iTsTnQ6Vp8SfxmxCnQCB"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZ4sUABus9MRL63tqgKHv3Tb2iTsTnQ6Vp8SfxmxCnQCB","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

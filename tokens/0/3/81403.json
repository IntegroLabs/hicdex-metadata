A dynamic and generative piece. The OBJKT is generated based on the viewer's wallet ID. If the OBJKT has an orange border, it means the viewer could not be detected - try connecting your wallet. Clicking on the OBJKT will switch to preview mode, where random instances will be shown in a slideshow.  Tested on Win(FF,Chrome,Edge) and iOS & Android - please let me know if you encounter an environment where this breaks.","tags":["Generative","Dynamic","WebGL","GLSL","Syntopia"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"application/x-directory","uri":"ipfs://QmVViSdESJp5xna7s9mWv1yj745wrBbKWT5cRNtCqH6aQy"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVViSdESJp5xna7s9mWv1yj745wrBbKWT5cRNtCqH6aQy","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbgJrXLG6NSRfyatvvgnhR1Mv3Eezr66QyoPUFdpapKyY","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 683403, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Consequence", "description": "Anything in life will always be related to causal law. All choices always cause unpredictable consequences. It could be in accordance with expectations or could have ended failure. As humans we often get the consequences of whatever we do, even from spontaneous things that we don't realize bring enough fatal consequences.\n\nOften I see extraordinary potential but ultimately trapped, imprisoned and helpless by the consequences. But often I see, someone cannot accept the consequences of his choice. Consequences can be scary but can also rescue the steps that have never been conditioned.\n\nIn the end, we are all the consequences of what we do in the past. Even though we have to try to undergo all the consequences with crying and pretending to be calm. As an artist, inevitably we have to play a role, grow and continue to advance in the future with all consequences that have never been imagined. then enjoy and love the consequences of each of us.\n\nregards,\n\nMontha.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQAoVknqJ4aUfzwTErzFxMzYWhe9TAbDj4NU7TqfcgdUo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdmodKQU7ToEzvajjWSFn142ufWuTW4zNTBYzZZSPCfer", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQAoVknqJ4aUfzwTErzFxMzYWhe9TAbDj4NU7TqfcgdUo", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz29vLDxXiXkU5SY75ebaCmkJRSUuMRrBUf2"], "tags": ["Montha", "digitalpainting", "Lowbro", "PopSurealist", "popart"], "extra": {}}

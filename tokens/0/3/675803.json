{"__version": 1, "token_id": 675803, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LLORANDO / ROLLANDO", "description": "Spanish anagrams are some of my favorites things to think about. I'm neither a native speaker, nor am I perficient at speaking it, but what I lack in ability...I excel at analysis. Spanish is one of those languages that when hearing it makes you want to learn the language even more; it's so beautiful and melodic. This is incredibly subjective of me to say, but almost everything spoken in Spanish sounds romantic. You could be cursing someone out and it would still sound lovely. lol All that being said, LLORANDO (Crying) / ROLLANDO (Rolling) is an anagram that was stewing in my mind for years and years and it was only till this day that I finally put my thoughts to paper and wrote it out. Though the words are not connected (pun intended) to each other in terms of definitions or connotations, they are connected by the reality that both are progressive verbs with the ANDO ending.

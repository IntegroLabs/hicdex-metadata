It is a screen capture from a user engagement with the interactive animated dynamic collage.  DareNotSpeakItsName is composed from my photographs and video, as well as appropriated images, texts, sound, and dialogue from \"The Wizard of Oz\", gay porn videos, and news articles about the controversial attempt to teach tolerance of homosexual families in public schools.","tags":["pixelart","8bit","collage","random","pixel","8-bit","gay","queer","art","grid","interactive"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmWGCWy7PTi8fi68ZpiQwhMFNgV9JVy7Yi7TZmdEoBP9pJ"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWGCWy7PTi8fi68ZpiQwhMFNgV9JVy7Yi7TZmdEoBP9pJ","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

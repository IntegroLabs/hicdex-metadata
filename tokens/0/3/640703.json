He was known as the 'Lord of the Hallowed Land' - the necropolis - and Khenty Amentiu, 'Foremost of the Westerners' - the Land of the Dead was thought to be to the west, where the Egyptians buried their dead. (Khenty Amentiu was the name of a previous canine deity who was superseded by Anubis.) The worship of Anubis was an ancient one - it was probably even older than the worship of Osiris. In the pyramid texts of Unas, his role was already very clear - he was associated with the Eye of Horus and he was already thought to be the guide of the dead in the afterlife, showing them the way to Osiris. In the text, it was written that \"Unas standeth with the Spirits, get thee onwards, Anubis, into Amenti, onwards, onwards to Osiris.\" \nCreated by Jibans/AI Twitter @ Bans_ji", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUtk7U9Qo7VA5rx1GaxYsiU1RUW7hxsiMg3VcxgoVfuzY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSvdM1ka4fFwh6x1ddRnKEtGtgSXRYeXkbJkwSzMFUMkw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmVMmkzZrUmbtKZ9PrjofBG2Yy7wb4xjMvH8ZAGBhtLXTk", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUtk7U9Qo7VA5rx1GaxYsiU1RUW7hxsiMg3VcxgoVfuzY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PvshRxQ28uzKvVV1LPsxYHGVpHPpyt1GE"], "tags": ["Digitalart", "art", "Jibans", "Egyptian", "Africa", "Anubis"], "extra": {}}

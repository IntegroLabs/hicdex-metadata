For some, activities make times feel imperceptible, to the point of waiting indefinitely, which feels like forever.\n\nInteracting with The Time is a confusing and depressing activity to handle. It's like being pushed straight out of a cardboard box, space you've been struggling with all these wonderful and shitty things that life has given.\n\nHe also invites his friends and talks about lost time, which cannot be retrieved or reclaimed. I knew it already but didn't always reflect on it.\n\nIt was still strange, but he still smiled at me, maybe because he saw all the precious memories I kept neatly and didn't merge with the box I was currently working on.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZcyfAigmrjj7EW8CzT3FKdJtANPABFzXkf8DBusDjG2e", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUj8Usm3uFmbfpbqBAmLGiJb9xaXkcyehhfk43d19j2LD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZcyfAigmrjj7EW8CzT3FKdJtANPABFzXkf8DBusDjG2e", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hzAsBJzifph6288TAmwSZsW94pgK8fWAz"], "tags": ["Drawing", "Art", "InteractionwithUnknown", "Watercolor"], "extra": {}}

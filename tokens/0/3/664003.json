Oscar Reutersv\u00e4rd is the real pioneer of impossible constructions but Roger Penrose rediscovered this figure in 1934 and Escher was inspired by it (tnx Wiki).\nAnd why Escher? One day, I was offered a book on Escher. I asked who is it? You'll see, your drawings make me think of him. Today, many years later, if sometimes I play mentally with 3d, I can say that I will never equal Escher, I will never have his mathematical rigor nor his patience and I never use a ruler or of compass. I just escape with a stroke of the pencil and sometimes geometric constructions occur... That's all!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQvLLUCVLSYb2Voh9vPL9DAXLi25paFP3gvKW94ygBs3v", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfGxrHCSLfGmwJy4CZfSTSPcRWZHKPrZSS1tePiiUdTxD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQvLLUCVLSYb2Voh9vPL9DAXLi25paFP3gvKW94ygBs3v", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aVTWtMA8DWYFQkWLKb1iicEeBJAnZi7Yd"], "tags": ["Escher", "tree", "pencil", "illustration", "impossible", "Penrosetriangle"], "extra": {}}

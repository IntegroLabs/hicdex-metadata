It served as research and promo material for a Trapcode TAO tutorial + AFTER EFFECTS I made inspired by a piece by Bees and Bombs (Dave Whyte). At time on 20/09/16 I asked him (after recording the tutorial) if he was ok with me publishing this. He was kind enough to give me the permission so we can call this an \"unofficial collab\" since while I was recording it he wasn't aware it was going on. ------------------------------------*RERENDER* (depth of field was added. It wasn't implemented in the plugin at the time these were made initially + VFX optical glow was also added. ---------------------------------------------- 1024x1024 | 360frames | 30FPS ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nYoutube Video Tutorial : http://bit.ly/2GTguVi", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfKYzBWfYfFsqAkWmjredXYKu8ViGqWiN6E4T3rAaa82Z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfKYzBWfYfFsqAkWmjredXYKu8ViGqWiN6E4T3rAaa82Z", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfKYzBWfYfFsqAkWmjredXYKu8ViGqWiN6E4T3rAaa82Z", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1c9w66mt5BYvXg9PW9LHNiSZwxzYp1EtxR"], "tags": ["beesandbombs", "collab", "rings", "3d", "trapcodeTAO", "hypnotic", "pattern", "learn", "davewhyte", "tribute", "aftereffects"], "extra": {}}

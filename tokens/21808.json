Actually, being asleep is the job. There's snoring on the soundtrack as the dog's long, flat tongue flutters behind the broken-picket fence of its wet, white teeth. The video is an example of the \"malignant-benign\". The dog is napping (benign), but his mouth looks like a tunnel of death (malignant) at a carnival, accompanied by drool.

Back in 90' there was a game store with lots of nintendo and playstation stuff to keep kids amused. In 00's there was a music store with teen music (best punk rock albums were found there). And now aging millenials come here to buy some stuff for joints that doesn't feel well anymore in such rainy day. At least it pays some respect to our retrofuturistic neon memories back then.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmcT5YAkixrU68uG4ecsqEmPpfKmxwYkWXXeZo6CjKrqZB","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1dGqpZgbxBeePwYUsXrSApqgEMCxwqn8tW"],"tags":["photoart","painting","neon","noir","night","photography","cyberpunk","soviet","postsoviet","ukraine","dark","colorful","street","citylights","streetlights","vibe","vibes","drugs","drugstore","pharmacy","ambient","ambience","stillness","nightphoto","photography","wallpaper"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmcT5YAkixrU68uG4ecsqEmPpfKmxwYkWXXeZo6CjKrqZB"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmTzouAYhdS97XSuu5Tyeh72DNoBHdNd1ryNSo9TtXXnum"},"supply":"20","transfered":40}

They're transferable – Unlike exchange-traded fungible tokens, NFTs are bought or sold on special marketplaces. However, their value depends on their uniqueness. 3. They're authentic – Blockchain technology powers non-fungible tokens. Therefore, you know that your NFT is genuine, since it’s nearly impossible to create counterfeits with a decentralized immutable ledger. 4. They preserve ownership rights – Again, this refers to an NFT’s use of decentralized platforms where no owner can alter the data once committed.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmdrjfp8FRbnULUoZygAjSekE9Nnjae1vcDbvgXdquFrAg","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1dE4hr6TWonFbqEt6Hme41MZLnz6oXd48g"],"tags":["play","landscape","ai",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmdrjfp8FRbnULUoZygAjSekE9Nnjae1vcDbvgXdquFrAg"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmQaA8SMZScxzzm91pshbUVXdKkAVecHDiYxh9rQynkB6L"},"supply":"100","transfered":100}

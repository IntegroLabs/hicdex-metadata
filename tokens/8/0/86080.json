This Ephemera shows the progressive exploration of the CRYPTOPLASM concept. It is made from a relic of BLACK MORTAR - WORKSITE IV which took place in Tallinn, between the 19 and 24 of November 2020 at the Tallinn Art Biennale, curated by Roland Reemaa and Laura Linsi. This 3D scanned black mortar is recomposed to build an autonomous architectural vocabulary that will be adopted to create complete AR or printed cryptoplasmic architectures.

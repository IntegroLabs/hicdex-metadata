In that period, life started to falling apart.  All I thought were certainties started to crumble.   Suddenly I was alone, felt sad and with black pain in my heart.  Time moved slow.   Drinking - smoking - drawing: my life was punctuated by this rhythm.  Every night I was at the desk to take my mind off, every night.   I finally woke up from nightmares.  I was depressed and could see only darkness around me.  Nyctophilia is a page of my life history but at the same time,  is a hymn to the powerful regenerative magic of the night,  that saved me from the brink.","tags":["ILLUSTRATION","FIGURATIVE","FIGURES","DARK","DARKART","NIGHT","HORROR"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmS7L8hjpAUqUDtTdUawgWbkUN2QsztEVKGMmqZPYrhfcr"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmS7L8hjpAUqUDtTdUawgWbkUN2QsztEVKGMmqZPYrhfcr","display_uri":"ipfs://QmSpVzsRedEQFwzZnvVcWyPfNxn97K5N9ph88VF6UV3kNY","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

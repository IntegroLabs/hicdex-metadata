In that period, life started to falling apart.  All I thought were certainties started to crumble.   Suddenly I was alone, felt sad and with black pain in my heart.  Time moved slow.   Drinking - smoking - drawing: my life was punctuated by this rhythm.  Every night I was at the desk to take my mind off, every night.   I finally woke up from nightmares.  I was depressed and could see only darkness around me.  Nyctophilia is a page of my life history but at the same time,  is a hymn to the powerful regenerative magic of the night,  that saved me from the brink.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS7L8hjpAUqUDtTdUawgWbkUN2QsztEVKGMmqZPYrhfcr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSpVzsRedEQFwzZnvVcWyPfNxn97K5N9ph88VF6UV3kNY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1azz9SdoHN5vWsfgRJ2NdWrY2BykATEkNJ"], "tags": ["ILLUSTRATION", "FIGURATIVE", "FIGURES", "DARK", "DARKART", "NIGHT", "HORROR"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmS7L8hjpAUqUDtTdUawgWbkUN2QsztEVKGMmqZPYrhfcr"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmNUPE1uGjcQ6ifAoVQN2f2mp86K1JoE2Zo3QncuTf92hx"}, "supply": "50", "transfered": 53}

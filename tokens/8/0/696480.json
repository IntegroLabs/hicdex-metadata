However, the true source of motivation for its use in this work is an incredibly badass Ukrainian woman who told Russian attackers that they were about to die and that they should put sunflower seeds in their pockets so that flowers would grow from their rotting corpses. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re occupants. You\u2019re fascists. What the fuck are you doing on our land with all these guns?\n\nTake these seeds and put them in your pocket, so at least sunflowers will grow when you all die here.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut the sunflower seeds in your pockets, please. You will die down here with the seeds. You came to my land.\n\nDo you understand? You are occupiers. You are enemies.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJJ8zmcBH2A&t=4s\n\nPNG 2048\u200a\u00d7\u200a2560", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcjW1fBwVvmEiuakkPKbgg3g3nvtSTUK9TYmU5DhMbiZ6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZreuiDRtzQC9wBQ92kkJBZCRfGFmtesXqF3QroPhWtrj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcjW1fBwVvmEiuakkPKbgg3g3nvtSTUK9TYmU5DhMbiZ6", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h4ZeTBtnKcZxw7S2Zx5oHrw1pjb8rWWan"], "tags": ["AI", "NeuralArt", "Poster", "Ukraine", "Sunflower"], "extra": {}}

She is the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. Hera rules over Mount Olympus as queen of the gods. A matronly figure, Hera served as both the patroness and protectress of married women, presiding over weddings and blessing marital unions. One of Hera's defining characteristics is her jealous and vengeful nature against Zeus' numerous lovers and illegitimate offspring, as well as the mortals who cross her.\n\n\ud835\udd6c\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd87\ud835\udd9e \ud835\udd70\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd86", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX9HitqjYj75NfRR8obuw6W9zCHiUdN59biaaY6NViP7y", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc8ht15itYzYH6taHzkBRVLuzJx14b1tZs2296fHcbsGM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX9HitqjYj75NfRR8obuw6W9zCHiUdN59biaaY6NViP7y", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TLj8gCKRk7Ja2fAa8szk8eX2JMWDwFHfq"], "tags": ["goddess", "illustration", "darkart", "dark", "woman", "nft", "mythology", "digitalart", "digital", "nftart", "art", "collection", ""], "extra": {}}

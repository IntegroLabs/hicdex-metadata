This Green Gorgon is a work of art that evokes the 'femme fatale' as much as the 'bête noire' persona - both in its beauty and in its beast aspects. A gorgeous and naïve maiden. A dangerous and challenging woman. In short, it is a mask with a body to be unveiled.","tags":["medusa","animation","mythology","diy","art","sideface","design"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmRp8DSCRg9U33NxzX5qnwu4CFUsT9xZ9aRUmTbE55hPdX"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRp8DSCRg9U33NxzX5qnwu4CFUsT9xZ9aRUmTbE55hPdX","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

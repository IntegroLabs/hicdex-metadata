Remains of victims who answered incorrectly litter the foreground. (The solution is the human, who crawls as a baby, strides upright in maturity, and uses a cane in old age.) Moreau made his mark with this painting at the Paris Salon of 1864. Despite the growing prominence of depictions of everyday life, he portrayed stories from the Bible, mythology, and his imagination. His otherworldly imagery inspired many younger artists and writers, including Odilon Redon and Oscar Wilde.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXbkkDvhNhyCixGDurUNFEmoGwX6q7qStcZuUUdvpE7n9", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmegu9hkiDdWtok8wXF7NEkbVxTD8Snirt12MHbUKUzFU5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXbkkDvhNhyCixGDurUNFEmoGwX6q7qStcZuUUdvpE7n9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Po4ePpSWy2vbBPm41z7vZCjjTTxETaUM6"], "tags": ["art"], "extra": {}}

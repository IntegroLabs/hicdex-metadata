{"__version": 1, "token_id": 676980, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "TETHER OG TOGETHER", "description": "The word TOGETHER is an interesting word to play with. In an earlier page, we saw how we can split it into three parts to read TO GET HER and how we can make a narrative with it. In this work, we split it in a different way and capacity to alter the meaning of a narrative. This time we remove the OG and leave the T and the ETHER. When combined T and ETHER, spell out TETHER. OG is a slang term meaning Original Gangster. Let's put it all together (pun intended) and make a new narrative that never existed before! Exciting right? When we combine all of it we get: TETHER OG TOGETHER. This counts as a syntax crystal as we're not making anagrams, we're simply removing letters and juxtaposing layers on top of each other. If we tether the word TETHER and the acronym OG together, interestingly enough, we get the word TOGETHER. If we zoom out from our focus a bit, all of this seems like a meta syntax crystal and somewhat of an autological phrase. Another aspect that I particularly enjoy is how the word together begins to untether from itself ironically. So not only do we have all of the original complexity, we've added another layer, this time it's the negation of being together, which is the antithesis of the point of the whole artwork.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRiZ9sHFpkEWPHAbSFybdP29QKeXbkZrW8efvVk5CCSUF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcrdKPPsVk2t7HSraLRrvkB6XwFpMygwVCQq4825CyakX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRiZ9sHFpkEWPHAbSFybdP29QKeXbkZrW8efvVk5CCSUF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

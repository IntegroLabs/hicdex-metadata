{"__version": 1, "token_id": 668580, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Freakshow", "description": "Sometimes, I pay attention to the life around me, there is always something unique or maybe strange every day.  I also always feel a surprise every time that passes and makes surprised, happy, sad, angry or other expressions.  Maybe, this world is composed of strange particles but that's where it attracts us so that we still want to survive. Like the world of art, which always has its own surprises and oddities, but that is what keeps all artists alive and in love with art.\n\n\nFor me, something strange (or being freak) is interesting, because in strange there is always innovation and also has different principles. We usually call something strange because  it\u2019s not as usual or unusual as usual.  (Being freak) doesn't always mean wrong, it's just a variety of surprises.\n\n\nThe freak show can represent anyone, including me or you.  Stuck in a freak figure, find a strange time, or a strange moment.  Everything in this world is strange, I, you, they are all freak, NFT is also strange but precisely because of that strangeness we all live.  So congratulations on playing or enjoying the freak show.\n--------------------------------------------------\nThank you for appreciating my artwork\nIf you have collected this artwork, don't forget to share it on your social media (twitter @KyreMontha, instagram @okyreymontha) and tag me.\n\nBest Regards,\nMontha", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXVaa7er39xGLNVKpCoZUcWu2k7SbXGD9VKXDr1USVLz1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWBwpCjU9Zo5Z49WX8yqL4Cp8ecVesagmWV55cajR7y39", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXVaa7er39xGLNVKpCoZUcWu2k7SbXGD9VKXDr1USVLz1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz29vLDxXiXkU5SY75ebaCmkJRSUuMRrBUf2"], "tags": ["Montha", "digitalpainting", "popart", "popsurealist", "lowbrow", ""], "extra": {}}

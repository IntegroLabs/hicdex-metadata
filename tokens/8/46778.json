My favorite part is the green streak of the ghost bus. It was shot on an L16, which is a CRAZYYY looking camera with 16 lenses on the front (Google: “L16 camera” if you want to see the camera). FYI: My birthday is May 27, the same date as my Harvard 2021 Commencement and graduation!","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWzW6fAVCX1ZEejqgiq9JPNHa3hFdQ3BVDQCZbmC9jHrM","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1dULtARqzvxR96eXhUCMwz9P6ST7bYxfeX"],"tags":["PHOTO","DIGITALPHOTO","LONGEXPOSURE","NIGHTSHOT","URBAN","BOSTON","LIGHTING","BUS","TRANSPORTATION"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmWzW6fAVCX1ZEejqgiq9JPNHa3hFdQ3BVDQCZbmC9jHrM"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmPVTroV49cDTrSBXFCNArw99a9FejBaNuNJ5Wrq77Rdpz"},"supply":"100","transfered":100}

As always, my bank does not allow me to buy cryptocurrencies. I have to adapt to keep exploring. But XTZs can't be minted like Ether (which I had to learn to do to mint my NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain) Raoul gave me 3XTZ. Thanks to him, I can finally mint my NFTs on the Tezos blockchain. To thank him, my first NFT is for him. There will be 111 copies. The profits from each sale will be donated to him. Make him rich! Me, I mostly have fun (but you can also make me rich a little ! I'm a single mom... I do vector art)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTvJJpkyGtDzuJNCXaFydPFUyh9V5M3rxYCCpRQiM3Wjm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTvJJpkyGtDzuJNCXaFydPFUyh9V5M3rxYCCpRQiM3Wjm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": [ "tz1VR3yEyqhn8VJAQpVozVsdRSWDgd7KDJJX" ], "tags": [ "gif", "thanks", "letters", "colors", "red", "black", "vectorart", "miartist" ], "formats": [ { "mimeType": "image/gif", "uri": "ipfs://QmTvJJpkyGtDzuJNCXaFydPFUyh9V5M3rxYCCpRQiM3Wjm" } ], "token_info": { "@@empty": "ipfs://QmPiNJm4JRTcWAmKiZcoHovSrNcMjuLb3qSEVhvMgwp2Bi" }, "supply": "111" }

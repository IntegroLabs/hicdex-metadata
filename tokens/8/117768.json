{"name": "In LOVE / Digital NFT", "description": "This NTF is from a bold artist for strong people. People who can look outside the box and make bold decisions inspire the artist. The artist is delighted with her contemporaries, people who are open to new impressions and innovations. Artist painted a portrait of a modern girl of the 21st century with a tattoo on her arm. Her dress reflects the freedom of her worldview, but she is not afraid to show it. A tattoo on the arm indicates courage and freedom of expression. And at the same time, it is closed. We do not see her eyes, we can read about her secret thoughts on her face, perhaps she is in love and dreamily brooding. Energetic splashes of paint make you plunge into the abyss of her emotions. And these emotions are universal. Something deeply touches us and makes us empathize. The NFT is based on Vera DG's painting on canvas.

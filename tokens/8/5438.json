We have difficulty finding a form because of the many forms presented to us. We find ourselves lost in the wide spectrum of known unknowns. Shape shifting from one form to another we try to present ourselves as a whole and as singular to the outside world like on social media but what we feel is that, we all are formless and multiple. We choose but it will never be completely fulfilling or feel completely right. Uncertainty is our greatest certainty. It almost seems like the more certain we act and present ourselves, the more uncertain we are. like a defense mechanism against chaos.  In my work i use this uncertainty. Never reaching an end or a clear path it always shape shifts into another form. Sometimes this is visible in one work but you can see this best across the whole span of many of my works. Always bobbin’ and weavin’ in between definitions, dancing on a tightrope between high and low art while mocking both definitions.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbJmM3Q1dL9xFdK7CGd9uKg9USQo439QMTzDP6JGV3jP9","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmbJmM3Q1dL9xFdK7CGd9uKg9USQo439QMTzDP6JGV3jP9"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmTnJ2jUJUGodjgvwLHgwFqzC1XQRH7bJUg5CrZyzEKunp"},"supply":"1","transfered":3}

SPECIAL EDITION.", "description": "SPECIAL BONUS HOLOGRAM EDITION from \u201cNightmares\u201d collection.\nIt\u2019s a collection created to celebrate Halloween that revives the most common and darkest nightmares that haunt the human being. 8 collectible card amulets that explain the most terrifying fears and give protection to those who have them.\n\nDescription of the piece:\nIf we dream about a witchcraft ritual, which we are not practicing or anyone we recognize, it means that we want to achieve by any means the things that we think we deserve. If in the dream we see that someones do witchcraft to another person, it could be interpreted as the desire to punish others for some damage they have done to you.\nDreaming that you practice an act of witchcraft for a good purpose means that you like to help people and is an omen of luck and blessings. \nBut if you dream about known people practicing black magic, it means that they could be hurting you or someone else. If you are the victim of witchcraft it means that your own decisions will hurt yourself. Possibly you are choosing the wrong path, living with toxic people, getting involved in a problematic relationship or maybe you are being manipulated by someone.\n\nMP4 - 1157x1600px\n\nFull story here: nft.matiasmarano.com/nightmares", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmboGVHvS49H8biooS6aoTDQfzsCtFuVYBSywEht3QNGYi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQumHR897N4vSfkumTYu8iXaqvQoaxcKbVSX3UXkvbkfi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmboGVHvS49H8biooS6aoTDQfzsCtFuVYBSywEht3QNGYi", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2NzvDGTtWUd195Yi5YewHXSY6mEwbmWjF4"], "tags": ["illustration", "halloween", "nightmares", "dream", "2d", "HENHALLOWEEN", "gore", "digitalillustration", "painting", "ritual", "witchcraft", "skull", "crow", "candle", "tattoos", "collection", "paint", "blood", "matiasmarano", "card", "collectible", "hologram", "bonus", "special"], "extra": {}}

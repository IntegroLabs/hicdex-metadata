After 150 days working on this collection sometimes I'm not sure what is working and what isn't and change and redo things dozens of times. On top of that, I've been working over the top of the previous days design since Day 43, and there are so many layers in this file that I think it's about time I started from scratch again. So this will be the final day of this stint of overlays. And as a special occasion for Day 150, and because I can't make up my mind, today there will be 3 different 1 of 1s all of which are based on the same design. The 1 I decided was the final art, 1 zoomed out quite a bit, and 1 where EVERY layer was selected and I took a screen shot of the CRAZY amount of edges and points that emerged. I feel like this is a pretty cool milestone and it's not even half way there. Time to buckle down and let the real work begin!

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 479482, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "WEATHERCOCK WEATHERMAN", "description": "The word weather is another one of those mutant words that can have several words within the main word. In the case of weather we can find: we/eat/a/at/he/her. So when we combine weather to any other word like; cock or man, we can expand the possibilities of what absurd wordplay can be found. Between WEATHERCOCK & WEATHERMAN, we can create a very strange narrative of WE EAT HER COCK, WE EAT HER MAN. Sounds awful and frightening and yet, you can't look away; like a slow moving trainwreck of art. Lord only knows the critics at this point who are reading this are making notes on how absolutely bad this book is. If you've made it this far, congratulations. Take a break, put down the book and get a snack. We still have like 348 pages to go. Wait, what's that? My publisher said I should delete the part where I said for you, the reader, to stop reading the book. Don't listen to them...eat...you need strength to keep reading all this rubbish.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmetkJdmXiCeWcZie7tDRPAWN4mk6paVcBKMC8SUPiCQqK", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmesh5fKhUdJL9wBPuD17D2369948GVX1WQ7nURj2Pr7za", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmetkJdmXiCeWcZie7tDRPAWN4mk6paVcBKMC8SUPiCQqK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

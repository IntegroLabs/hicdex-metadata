In 2012 I founded nimda.co, and 3 years later I discoveredÂ nimda.co.il, a company that sells heavy weapons in the middle east. I used their corporate image to create several works, which were removed after I was accused of using war money. Through this letter, the different versions of nimda became one.","tags":["alonso","cedillo","nimda","corporation","tualonsocedillo","postinternet","post","internet","art","contemporary",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmeUMbcMheMWQaDSNMz6ZR7MTv8N5f2syys42VhVieHYUd"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmeUMbcMheMWQaDSNMz6ZR7MTv8N5f2syys42VhVieHYUd","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

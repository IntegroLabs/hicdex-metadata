Life begins at the point where hands touch each other.   We are the authority in our own lives. What we touch influences how we think and how our lives unfold.But, in general, we defer to a higher authority. This authority is sometimes the society and sometimes the power that directs the society. And the rules of that authority have now become our rules. What is left is our essence, which we keep hidden as secret. Life will begin if we can touch this essence.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPfirq4BDk1sfF1fnCNPtiyrJdWWPcsMYJ2MxFfeRrmzJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTLQTho9d4nqd5K9K2XcKpvJqKARaZWF7x9SvFoFDYA9m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1L7DrnGEMuhoeLUipJLL6N3wa6nsFNrqSF"], "tags": ["photography", "collage", "collab", "video", "gif", "mp4", "digitalart", "animation"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmPfirq4BDk1sfF1fnCNPtiyrJdWWPcsMYJ2MxFfeRrmzJ"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmXfLKLkgRD2ZKhNarFV2ayCjJnF2NVhmyWzwo8tz2AvTB"}, "supply": "10", "transfered": 25}

It gave us opportunities but we have to cut the others and we can\u2019t deny, it gave us pressure to always speaking even if we couldn\u2019t but we can\u2019t deny, it gave us a very bad sickness that we can\u2019t deny, it gave us a bad behavior to leave the work and we can\u2019t deny, it gave us something to hardly pull us up from everything, until our freedom become bias. We can\u2019t run, no matter what it is, we have to face it, it has to happen. It\u2019s been crazy!

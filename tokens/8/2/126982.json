{"__version": 1, "token_id": 126982, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Birds of a Feather Feeding Together", "description": "This captured observation, \"Birds of a Feather Feeding Together\" gives new meaning to the mid-16th century proverb, \"Birds of a feather flock together\". Benjamin Jowett, a British classical scholar, and a translator of Plato cited the phrase in his 1856 translation of Plato's Republic with the phrase... \"Men of my age flock together; we are birds of a feather...\". Over the years, ornithologists (zoologists who study the science of birds) have studied and documented the behavior of \"birds of a single species flying together than flocking together\". Here, the birds of interest are feeding together.   \ud83d\udc26 Full Disclosure: It must be noted that No birds, habitat, or any other living creatures were disturbed during the recording of this observation. \ud83d\udc26 Please note: Buyer(s) have the right to own, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer the NFT itself.

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 658182, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "40oz. to Freedom", "description": "40oz. to Freedom is the debut studio album by the Southern California ska-punk band Sublime, originally released on Skunk Records and later reissued by MCA. 40oz. to Freedom received mixed critical reviews upon its first release but has earned an improved public perception since. Sublime would not achieve any mainstream success until the release of their eponymous album in 1996, two months after the death of their lead singer and guitarist, Bradley Nowell. As of 2011, the album has certified sales of two million copies in the US and is Sublime's second best-selling studio album there (the self-titled album leads with six million). Along with The Offspring's 1994 album Smash, 40oz. to Freedom is one of the highest-selling independently released albums of all time.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSHdgGszgvd1NtYMYAAJXczH4LWu1hatHZQQdKeW97WBm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPTL3kso5mWNbGv9BrGj6QrDJqAWgcT6WkCqdVGQUvuc7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSHdgGszgvd1NtYMYAAJXczH4LWu1hatHZQQdKeW97WBm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i9Jbej7sM2TvtpZ9YrJr8wUtpZ91BQ6vf"], "tags": ["digitalart", "pixelart", "8bit", "sublime", "album", "cover", "ska", "punk"], "extra": {}}

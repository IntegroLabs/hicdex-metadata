Due to my passion for cars and supercars as well having done a lot artwork for a big German sportscar manufacturer i love to draw old and new models as well doing design studies. My second passion is drawing artworks for kidsbooks, where many have been published by one of the biggest German Brand in this industry.  All my drawings are handmade, starting with a sketch on paper with a pencil i later adopt them to my graphic suite to colorize them.  This illustration i made especially for my genesis into the NFT space and as a thank you for my new twitter accounts' followers.

My decision to focus on natural light as my primary subject matter is inspired from an abruptly transformative experience I had in my early twenties which is commonly called a Near Death Experience. Moments before this occurred, I was sitting on the floor of a bedroom when I intuitively felt that my body was drawing in its last breath. All of the sudden I was surrounded by black nothingness. I was no longer sitting on the floor of the bedroom, in fact, I had no awareness of having a body at all. All sense of identity and external surroundings vanished. Time, meaning, thought and emotion all ceased. Though this may sound terrifying, it was not. On the contrary, the entire experience was immensely peaceful. Surrounded by complete darkness, a single bright light began to reveal itself. This light, a visible incarnation of love itself, consumed my awareness and eventually brought me back into my body. Ever since then, my aim in this life is to honor that light that felt like my true home, a light that is not only seen with the eyes but felt with the heart. \n\nArtist Biography:\n\nAnna Thorne is a visual artist from the United States currently living and working in New York City.

I am 2 years old with high functioning autism. I am infatuated with planets and the Solar System. I can tell you facts about each one. For example, Jupiter has 79 known moons. I hope you find as much joy in my art as I have creating it. Collecting my work helps my parents make sure I get the support that I need and save for my future. I hope you like it and there's more to come!!

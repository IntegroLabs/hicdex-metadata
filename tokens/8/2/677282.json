Based on comparisons to self-portraits, Pratt is the man at the easel, an accomplished portrait painter. The identities of the other artists represented in the picture remain uncertain, but they are younger and they draw rather than paint. The composition explores the academic tradition as carried out among Americans in late-eighteenth century London.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmacUHSxMYHYpdYff86R3sVXxBp39TEy3VsBoDHJF4xMhM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPK61ARfnSVb5KQP9Ka3BK1N1AyLKWCwx91MxBz2WkrnK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmacUHSxMYHYpdYff86R3sVXxBp39TEy3VsBoDHJF4xMhM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Po4ePpSWy2vbBPm41z7vZCjjTTxETaUM6"], "tags": ["art"], "extra": {}}

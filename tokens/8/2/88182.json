Does it move? Does it do anything? Who made it? Should I enjoy it? Everything Donut is a series of 3D objects covered in donut glaze and sprinkles, as an ode to technical reproducibility and sugar. It’s digital. It’s made by use a machine. It’s not on a gallery. It’s pink. It’s been decades since Duchamp. Yet it’s pretty, but is it Art?  Everything Donut - Cup is the first of the series to be minted as an NFT. It combines the artist’s search for 3D realism, personal memories of her grandmother’s kitchen, and the ever present pink donut glaze.","tags":["3D","realism","render"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmYyYYpf8xYxUNavFQZbNuiDvRLwfs1gop6qUSMutzCeNC"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYyYYpf8xYxUNavFQZbNuiDvRLwfs1gop6qUSMutzCeNC","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

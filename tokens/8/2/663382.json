{"__version": 1, "token_id": 663382, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "CAT MOMENT", "description": "Inspired by the cat woman character who is actually an anti-hero but has an extraordinary heart. Cat woman known as criminal who carry out many theft activities against the elite, but the result is not to work for herself but to help others.\n\nThis artwork also marks the phenomenon of the widespread presence of cats in real life with evidence that has spread on social media. Cats are beloved pets, because they are docile, funny, playful and friendly.\n\nCat Moment combines the two phenomena above with hope of becoming a reflective medium to keep doing good with anyone, anytime and in anyway. Hopefully we can be like a cat Moment that is not only present but also lives that should be lived.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the second artwork from chapter 1 of my journey at nft. all works are done using digital painting without losing my style and soul which is usually present on canvas.\n\nThank you for appreciating my art.\nIf you have collected this artwork, don't forget to share it on your social media and tag me.\n\nBest Regards,\nMontha", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaX7PKntot8T59xjVJWPcYSj2GvqGDjLfHZw6owtwXn6e", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVrmUz7qD1R3TJquxV7dxYBJst59TZvenSv8Jp2Ha5Jgd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaX7PKntot8T59xjVJWPcYSj2GvqGDjLfHZw6owtwXn6e", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz29vLDxXiXkU5SY75ebaCmkJRSUuMRrBUf2"], "tags": ["Montha", "digitalpainting", "lowbro", "popart", "catwomen", "surrealist"], "extra": {}}

Users are ordered in the H=N blockchain by the date of their first mint or collect operation. Artists (users with at least one mint) add their block following the previous chain direction. Patrons (collectors without mints) change the chain direction by 90 degrees. If you ever minted or collected in H=N, you should see a blue block surrounded by a blue circle. That's you! Copyminters and other reported users are shown in red.","tags":["creativecoding","p5js","visualization","artists","patrons","collectors"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/svg+xml","uri":"ipfs://QmVdVp4zCWAwi7U489pQaBBfyRsZuseaCknR7BYSGZacqs"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVdVp4zCWAwi7U489pQaBBfyRsZuseaCknR7BYSGZacqs","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Generative algorithms (usually in the form of stochastic programming) have been a core component of artificial evolution after 2030, and have been used to generate the entire physics simulations used to describe much of the initial structure of the new (digital) universe.  The field of artificial intelligence has long envisioned using computers to automatically write stories. With the advent of machine learning, in particular neural networks, researchers have found new opportunities to automatically acquire narrative knowledge directly from text corpora such as online news sites. But this begs the question of how to select the most interesting and informative from the whole torrent of information that already flows into a program. There are many good ways to answer this question: text mining, question-answering, and so on. But each method would need a very large corpus to complete and understand the tasks at hand. We aim to present a new strategy for selecting interesting narrative artifacts.  Root's approach; machine learning for creative.

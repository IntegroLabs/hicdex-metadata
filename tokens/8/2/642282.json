{"__version": 1, "token_id": 642282, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ALL ALONE", "description": "Loneliness is the kind of emotion that has the unique ability to stack upon itself. There are different levels of loneliness: 1. Is there's something wrong with me and should I change. 2. Will I always feel this way? 3. Why am I even trying in the first place. 4. I miss people I love very deeply.  5. Public displays of crying. 6. I'm convinced I'm unable to bond with people. 7. I wish someone here would be proud of me. 8. I miss affection and human contact. Obviously, emotions are subjective to the person, but a good rule of thumb is that if you have one or two of these, you're loneliness is mild. If you have many or all of them, life can be a moment-to-moment experience for that individual. In ALL ALONE, we explore loneliness through the prism of an extended word pyramid syntax crystal. We see that parts of the words are obscured through matching with the gradient in the background as if to allude of the nebulousness of life's many malaises. We can see from the very top to the rock bottom, that the sense or emotion of loneliness can grow and grow till it festers into darkness and depression. If you or anyone you know is or has been alone for a long time, especially during and after the lockdowns of COVID19, please reach out to them. I know I've mentioned it on a previous page of this book, but many people out there need help. We all live on this planet together, let's act like we care about each other.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYe82eCyfxebK9LZeSB4vbggdCH13RzaTAPTRuQHgBWJ5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYeY7b5YXKWhtJ7T46bkdW7ub8mGSKDX45X3vVzikodv3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYe82eCyfxebK9LZeSB4vbggdCH13RzaTAPTRuQHgBWJ5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

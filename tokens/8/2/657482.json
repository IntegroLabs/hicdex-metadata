It has been defined as \"ware with a translucent body\" containing a minimum of 30% of phosphate derived from animal bone and calculated calcium phosphate.Bone china is the strongest of the porcelain or china ceramics, having very high mechanical and physical strength and chip resistance, and is known for its high levels of whiteness and translucency.Its high strength allows it to be produced in thinner cross-sections than other types of porcelain. Like stoneware it is vitrified, but is translucent due to differing mineral properties.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVKUvntPCHeWGTXHcePC5VG7aKjFvr7wdL626WyBknys5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTsz4Pq6fFdnAM7VexUqpwiEgfGFATyUmT6YRHT3vAXfa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVKUvntPCHeWGTXHcePC5VG7aKjFvr7wdL626WyBknys5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NnRVEU5EPZj4WfqXGMkDVwhChtiuHpC7g"], "tags": ["popart", "comics", "doodle"], "extra": {}}

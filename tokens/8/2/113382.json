Directed and edited live by pioneering live filmmaker Michael Beets and live composed by Domino. Shot on mobile phones; each creative was given the theme 'Pressure' to interpret in their footage (uncompressed render available). This is part of an ongoing series where each edition will aim to push and experiment live digital experiences, on H=N. Each sold NFT will go directly into paying the artists and delivering the next edition. Next Up- Edition Two: Audiences will receive a unique ticket that will give them access to a 3D world- a labyrinth of rooms. In each room, audiences will be able to watch a live stream of the composer; the director; the raw feeds of the cameras as they prepare for the show; and when it's ''showtime' move into the 'theatre' to watch...Dancers around the world performing to a live composed track in real-time.","tags":["film","photography","live","experience","art","livefilm"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmYCojtjs3WFQi7h9Lc54bccAznori5HDZ3NtczDPXedX1"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYCojtjs3WFQi7h9Lc54bccAznori5HDZ3NtczDPXedX1","display_uri":"ipfs://QmU8McRjyfDhawcZtQT3ct2nZByur1zy4jtHpGKE2yho7B","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

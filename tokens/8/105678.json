  "description": "In the digital work \"The Unknown Gray Portraits\" (from The Unknown Portraits Series), new fantasy portraits of unknown gray people are generated with every HTML refresh - from elements that were previously digitally painted. The combination is made up of 10 element types, each with up to 10 + 1 red variants. The works of The Unknown Portraits Series are digital drawings or paintings in which the artist addresses the \"portraitsâ€œ in the digital age - it's about avatars and profile pictures, face recognition and the handling of personal rights in today's world. It's about simplification. And it's about uniqueness. ",

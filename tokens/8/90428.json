When the Al100+ cluster melts at 620\u2212660 K, the threshold drops by \u223c1 eV (\u223c96 kJ/mol). A decrease in the activation energy of this magnitude causes a 108-fold increase in the reaction rate at the melting temperature. The decrease in the activation energy may result from the mobility of the surface atoms on the liquid cluster, which allows them to move to a lower energy arrangement as the N2 approaches.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSp3ecwv1Ejv3fQNTfmdUyaDp6Ug6ii1g2B8skrJQSXTj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1PYkCcWo6WRqGym585bRMLMq9jwwN2qSgH"], "tags": ["BW", "SPHERE", "SIMULATION", "3D", "ANIMATION", "SEAMLESS", "LOOP", "IMPACT", "MELT"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmSp3ecwv1Ejv3fQNTfmdUyaDp6Ug6ii1g2B8skrJQSXTj"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmYZ1gMg1cbFP7F84WBDPiuCkQAqUwHeaY3QoYzoPD3wFi"}, "supply": "11", "transfered": 48}

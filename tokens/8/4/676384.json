Most people have probably been in at least 1 relationship that didn't work out, and in my opinion that is a learning experience that is INVALUABLE in finding the RIGHT person to spend your life with. In my early 20's I was with someone for 5 years, we moved to Georgia together so I could go to The Portfolio Center and it ended quite badly. Like me spending 3 days in Fulton County jail bad. But as I said the whole experience changed me and I went on to meet the love of my life. I don't know if I would have ever seen how unbelievable she was if it weren't for the flogging I'd taken previously. We've been together for 15 years now, and my wife is straight up a fucking badass! She is an amazing mother, she is the most thoughtful person I know, and she rocks Vans and a pair of torn up jeans like a champion. She may have been exhausted from taking pictures all day but like I said yesterday, she never complained...verbally.

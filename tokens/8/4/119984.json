Each episode will feature the spinning DJ.24 logo and be minted in a very limited run. Clips from the actual show are used as reflectance material, and because each show is lit differently than the last, each episode's NFT will have it's own unique reflection. Episode 4 is particularly purple in honour of Prince's passing 5 years prior.","tags":["LiveMusic","Keepsakes","Logo","Merch"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://Qmd7N7AVMbEUXK23VHU4bPWNhYhW9Kg5CEXcSjF3xYhARP","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmd7N7AVMbEUXK23VHU4bPWNhYhW9Kg5CEXcSjF3xYhARP","display_uri":"ipfs://Qmd7N7AVMbEUXK23VHU4bPWNhYhW9Kg5CEXcSjF3xYhARP","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

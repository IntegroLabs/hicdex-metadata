Lorraine, Angel, and our friend/neighbor Mario were hanging out one night, drinking Baileys blended with chocolate cherry ice cream. I'm hardly even using DAWs at this point, and we all try to come up with some way to turn recorded sounds we make into music; at the core, isn't that the heart of the spirit of making music so many musicians seem to lose sight of?\n   _This_ is what I miss from my old social circles: who cares what talent anyone has? Let's just create works of art and music. We'll combine the skills we do have together. Just the 3 of us enjoying a nice creamy Baileys and just fucking around with bottles and palm branches.\n   I feel obligated to hold onto 1 token in case he ever comes back into my life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTXaxC4cUcpBzSCPgQNSH4N3aS9TK9LDWpKTiM5u1q8fd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXKKtSQbxrXkNbamaMPMNYJvX3zAPoMbsr1MjDsooQ8Va", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTXaxC4cUcpBzSCPgQNSH4N3aS9TK9LDWpKTiM5u1q8fd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PqogZ7ELvjZrVaAcM2sqKKrYNgm67pSVt"], "tags": ["Baileys", "Datamoshing", "livedatamoshing", "glitch", "glitchart", "experimental", "music", "fun", "friends", "synergy", "alcohol", "21+"], "extra": {}}

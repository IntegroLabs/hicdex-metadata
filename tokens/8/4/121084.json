The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","tags":["generative","cyclic","cellula","automata","gif"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmX6XAmoU3VM7Z21Y1TmNQib7mYZznXuz8KgN4DYByN99D","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmX6XAmoU3VM7Z21Y1TmNQib7mYZznXuz8KgN4DYByN99D","display_uri":"ipfs://QmX6XAmoU3VM7Z21Y1TmNQib7mYZznXuz8KgN4DYByN99D","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

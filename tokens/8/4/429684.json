I made sketch of this artwork when he was 6 years old. \nToday is his special day so I decided to put some colors from the base sketch and put it in here.\n\nI always see and portray him as a puma or black phanter, because he look that way haha.\nAlways being a good boi all these years. Even my friend said he is so creepy, because he always stare at me from the gate of my house.\n\nI want to treat him a wagyu beef haha, so I made this NFT artwork :)\n\nCheers!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSvxNhdMoADXsTjTBdCu6V5EX8T6EbjKTFk8ko6BcQAFt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUQ3VhEZvtgZjbE5nk2oatWhd7gDMmqa8FfGiGvVtMSo8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSvxNhdMoADXsTjTBdCu6V5EX8T6EbjKTFk8ko6BcQAFt", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VAsGtkiMKS6J7rJFvHgLpwC2tdTWM9SMX"], "tags": ["cat", "puma", "panthera", "tribute", "machine", "surreal"], "extra": {}}

This is one of a series of twelve statements developed in response to the first Low Carbon Design Institute residency. These works are designed to travel, to be collected and quickly passed on, resold for tiny amounts, if anything. They are made with the intention that the value and energy they hold should be temporary, momentary, fleeting. You see it once then let it go.

The take and the give. @joz_freeman", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS9rKT1yDKXLx2CDzjf5mmF19riEyTpEhR48mSxCsRDNv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS9rKT1yDKXLx2CDzjf5mmF19riEyTpEhR48mSxCsRDNv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS9rKT1yDKXLx2CDzjf5mmF19riEyTpEhR48mSxCsRDNv", "mimeType": "image/svg+xml"}], "creators": ["tz1Ww1SbEyjeNUkUzTrhgEuiTjaVBJD21kDx"], "tags": ["Lettinggo", "energy", "text", "collect", "climate", "release", "context", "convenience", "locdi"], "extra": {}}

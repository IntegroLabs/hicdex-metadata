Although macroscopic systems seem to us univocal, microscopically, they are the result of the chaos inherent to the most fundamental part of reality, collapsing only as a function of the observation relationship. Science shows us that the objective world in which we live suffers from a probabilistic irrationality and an intrinsic chaotic process, which takes us, each day, more and more, to our dissolution, towards the thermodynamic equilibrium. When we apply this thinking to art, we see art's own fragmentation and its stochastic and entropic nature in its contemporary development.

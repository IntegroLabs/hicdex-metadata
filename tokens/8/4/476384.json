The next track of sound nft is generated today/ 25.10.2021 This is procedural sound I made with my custom instrument - node based synthesizer I created custom coding in the software of Max/Msp. It is a combination of generative \"golden ratio\" based sequencer, power of \"2\", granular sound,  additive synthesis and some tricks with realtime rhythmic/harmonic structure.  All components are recorded in realtime from the live algorithm.  Liverecord of manipulations with algorhythms. listen / use / mix.  No external sound effects are used. Pure wave physics.

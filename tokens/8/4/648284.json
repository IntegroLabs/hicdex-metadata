{"__version": 1, "token_id": 648284, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Specials 6", "description": "Specials is an organic, explorative connection and growth system, currently releasing its veins throughout the Tezos blockchain. A name in a piece with a life of its own. And life\u2026 finds a way. \n\nIn the cool mist of daybreak in the ancient temperate forest, stood @VonDoyl, whose tendrils soon located @davidcheifetz, who then summoned @PasanenJenni, who sensed her way through the elements to discover @WiseApe4, who named @LaurenceFuller... \n\nThis piece was created with someone specific in mind. The person named in Specials 6 was chosen by our dear friend @LaurenceFuller. \n\nSpecials contain the name (mostly obscured) of an artist, collector, or friend. If all editions are collected, the name will be revealed on Twitter in a WIP pic. \n\n\"The One\" named in the piece gets two things:\n\n1) An edition airdropped. If he/she has already collected one, they can choose to get the airdrop, or name someone else it should go to.\n\n2) They nominate the name to be contained in the next piece.\n\n\n2000x2000 150 ppi. Edition of 10 @1.5 tez.

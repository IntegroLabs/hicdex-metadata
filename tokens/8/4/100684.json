It’s a group show showcasing the works of 15 Italian artists engaging with new technologies. To participate in the newly established dialogue about the crypto space, the show will include works offered as NFTs, making Subterranean Virtualscapes the first exhibition of its kind in the Italian art scene. The show will host one personal exhibition page for each artist: in order to contextualise the showcased artworks in a wider curatorial framework, the participants have had the opportunity to conceive a solo digital installation that includes additional elements, as well as the piece for sale.  virginiabianchi.com ONSHORE, 2021 1080x1350 pixels ","tags":["fredcosci","onshore","𝙎𝙪𝙗𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙚𝙖𝙣𝙑𝙞𝙧𝙩𝙪𝙖𝙡𝙨𝙘𝙖𝙥𝙚𝙨","virginiabianchigallery"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmbcdcwHTMAMa7FqpSqv4RbUxoC6MeyTBiPNwcan3SoA5U"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbcdcwHTMAMa7FqpSqv4RbUxoC6MeyTBiPNwcan3SoA5U","display_uri":"ipfs://QmedfTfRjhbk2LY2xv53S3FjrQ8dpNiiitkATZWxSLTwhk","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

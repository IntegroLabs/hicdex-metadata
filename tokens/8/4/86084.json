Moe)","description":"Moe is the only soldier left from the FingerPunk army. The FingerPunks at one time felt threatened by the ThumbPunks who spoke a different language, over time they learned to communicate and realized they naturally got along. Thus the FingerPunk army was dissolved. Moe never got his discharge papers, so now he has ascended to the rank of General and he relishes it a little too much to quit.","tags":["FingerPunks","FingerPunk"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmUfypTnE7zvzKjXLtLeRPyvV9SXBbbZxCR7M8h4BytRcF"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUfypTnE7zvzKjXLtLeRPyvV9SXBbbZxCR7M8h4BytRcF","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

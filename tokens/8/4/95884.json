The image was mirrored and pixelated using old-school photosuite vista software that came with a Vivitar camera at the time. The creation was part of my 'Flashcore x photography'. A collection I made at age 15 but never shared. Today, 24/05/21 I've recovered it from a CD to finally get seen.","tags":["sianvictoria","purplepassionflower","bug","digitalart","pixelated","mirrored"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmeSP6XiqyY8ZFTnVXNz2Tj6UBMw1p5e5Ud5PvKBhjUxsi"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmeSP6XiqyY8ZFTnVXNz2Tj6UBMw1p5e5Ud5PvKBhjUxsi","display_uri":"ipfs://QmRRZ4TkDNpjEadkQ2ozVCPWgKfZkPoUFL3qR1zjQ6NQsg","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

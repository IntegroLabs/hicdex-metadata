I use this feature and created many GIFs in recent years to express myself when I talk to people. On this GIF I was clearly very happy having the conversation with someone very close to me. In reply to something I wished to just send my sincere smile. Possibly I haven't been so happy since that period of time. But I still use this GIF to smile back and flirt online. And it makes me smile myself at times. Does it make you smile? Cherish those happy moments. Give the smile to somebody. twitter.com/feelosopher777", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSotQMHDEKiJRLw9Ead5bdz8GXZXusbU8Rd8DpmzzieWm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz2DaWYqtntv59GLLBULYTiubQs9EFr55aGo"], "tags": ["GIF", "animated", "communication", "smile", "smiling", "selfie", "online", "positive", "joy", "happy", "selfievideo", "blackandwhite", "bw", "bnw", "Telegram", "bodylanguage", "face", "Feelosopher"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/gif", "uri": "ipfs://QmSotQMHDEKiJRLw9Ead5bdz8GXZXusbU8Rd8DpmzzieWm"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmZMwJ1ucnXNRgWNUvrdgkchkTaQeEcLhVh3ZZaqJSqAfo"}, "supply": "21", "transfered": 0}

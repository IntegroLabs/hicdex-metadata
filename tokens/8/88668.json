This modification allows the image to be bent and twisted, decomposed into lines and gradients. The movement captured in this series was produced with sound waves, generated with custom software on a laptop and amplified using home stereo equipment. A strange assemblage of processes and electronic devices come together in a network of media histories. Each device and its treatment of the image, or encoding of a signal, leaves its fingerprint in this ethereal assemblage of artifacts. Created at Signal Culture in 2019 as part of their artist in residence program.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZMPp1k4WYgRYqY2voseBMTEpidi43xc8CgCyCD7UhVsa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1PZ7a2uDxKHd2NouLrDyjFVfpvpfJ3HBNR"], "tags": ["Lines", "Curves", "Analog", "Video", "VideoArt", "BW", "BlackandWhite", "calm", "flow", "meditative", "minimal", "synthesis", "videosynthesis"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmZMPp1k4WYgRYqY2voseBMTEpidi43xc8CgCyCD7UhVsa"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmVAnSbF2uWHnJc1YcJUEbZgf8A9ZS5PUF92XPqCDS7mmm"}, "supply": "1", "transfered": 1}

{"name": "Saci", "description": "This is Saci, a character that has its origins among the indigenous people in the south, from where it would have spread throughout the Brazilian territory. The saci is a young black imp with one leg, always with his red hood that grants him magical powers. Considered a playful figure, who has fun with animals and people, doing little tricks that create domestic difficulties, or scaring night travelers with their whistles - quite acute and impossible to be located. That is how he braids the horses' hair, after leaving them tired with running; it disrupts the cooks' work, making them burn their food, or even adding salt to the sugar containers or vice versa; or travelers get lost on the roads.", "tags": ["Brazil", "Folkart", "Folk", "Digitalart"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmVBToGfcobrhm4dhce6xZatESGZHghqAN2huWiYE35rz5", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmXG7vzfsP161f1YMwoNsaccdXXjH5EDKnLjnt96qVFgGf", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1UG4oadhRK9JWBKpvs5Bwn4Y5jtaFa8fmb"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVBToGfcobrhm4dhce6xZatESGZHghqAN2huWiYE35rz5", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

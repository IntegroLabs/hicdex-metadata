Simple, make it use basic math functions like fractions, rational equations, and algebra. Did we lose you yet? lol Let's take a deeper look at what makes this artwork functional. We notice that the entire page looks like your 6th grade math class, only instead of using numbers, we're using words and letters. We can begin to perform processes to solve the equation. Fortunately for us each of the steps are written out to show the progress. First step would be to cancel out the fractions within the parenthesis and wipe out MY EGO from the art work; a task I do daily for the artworks. We then multiply SENTENCE by 1...giving us the same answer SENTENCE. We're now out of the parenthesis and we add the letter \"i\", giving us our end result; sentience. When we look at the very last line, we have SENTIENCE = SENTIENCE, which equals and balances out the equation. We have successfully made nerd math art. So in essence by add ourselves or \"i\" into to a sentence, as if to intimate that when we speak a sentence, it's a reflection of our own sentience as a human being.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSmN2bFJDkbigz6ohGhxBqjp2zSe3bPesTYXjAmLMtbgE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ7QGJPEB486N3Er2nr3H8Y1ndcJq9Nv8oceaPHKP13K3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSmN2bFJDkbigz6ohGhxBqjp2zSe3bPesTYXjAmLMtbgE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

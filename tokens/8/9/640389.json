Unlike generative adversarial networks (GANs), these are generated with a Transformer-based autoregressive deep neural network model that probabilistically predicts each discrete mesh surface one at a time to eventually compose a plausible chair or table. It is trained on thousands of 3D digital furniture models in a deliberately sub-optimal mode to generate a formal familiarity with a tint of the degenerative and dysfunctional \u2013 an artistic mediation on inclusive and posthuman design in the age of AI.\nhttps://artificial-architecture.ai | IG: @artificialarchitecture.ai | TW: @AAlab_ai", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdLYAdiZJiDGoWiYYLZ4avMaJQU7B3tXUAtTLp7wCPmos", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQNTAdkMzVr1PUdsSpeRgfu96AJ4iw73TRuXdYjz4KVX9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdLYAdiZJiDGoWiYYLZ4avMaJQU7B3tXUAtTLp7wCPmos", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz2KJkfKomTCxbgs9UNtZTNtA7osBWyJ3qcv"], "tags": ["3D", "aiart", "ai", "design", "architecture", "sampling", "plasticity", "artificial", "generative", "destructive", "uncanny", "deeplearning", "deepneuralnetworks"], "extra": {}}

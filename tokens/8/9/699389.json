Look into the eye of the hurricane of my life. There's a calmness within my aging, I mean raging storm. (Sorry, Freudian slip there.)  No one's life is easy and/or perfect. No matter what happens to me in my life, I've been genuinely practicing to have stillness of mind. The center of my storm is a quiet location where I observe the natural world and reality.

It's not easy, but it works.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQFdSJLq3VbHV4SYX3ftWG42byB7fzU1wpRDKpAtW1hb8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXeixsDEGBJgM11B88PikV2vzM2vJi5McRxbkxuHMr1Ch", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQFdSJLq3VbHV4SYX3ftWG42byB7fzU1wpRDKpAtW1hb8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

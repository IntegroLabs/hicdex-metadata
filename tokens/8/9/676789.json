I think that you have been a free and original person for years with his style, music and stance. I can say that I grew up listening to him in my childhood. \n The first thing that came to my mind when I saw the photograph that I took as a reference while making this artwork was the strength card from the tarot cards. The strength card tells us about our freedom, our personal space, our own potential and strength. Emphasizes that we should be both a king as free as a lion and tamed like a cat but unique to ourselves. I thought it wouldn't be wrong to describe a legend like Snoop Dogg with this card.\n I reinterpreted the photograph in my own style and painted it as if it were in front of the strength card painting that I reconstructed in my own style.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeDxYU35yokdv2YtePWkCXaKL53iq4vkTU3D6q8sYuazd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSB4mYczUafx5qJPop4efFcimFzV4jGhGWC8ZkHudiaXo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeDxYU35yokdv2YtePWkCXaKL53iq4vkTU3D6q8sYuazd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TQLTrasjakNNfkKQMZs6BAuw1h3mefkC2"], "tags": ["digitalart", "illustration", "snoopdogg", "cat", "strenghtcard"], "extra": {}}

Every time you would get back there, it would be just as you left it, ready for you to pick up the building and make this place whole. It has been your haven for some time, but other sleep kingdoms have taken your attention away and your little temple hasn\u2019t been visited by its owner for some time. You should go again, a creeper might have stolen your sweets while you were away.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXf6J1wgMLBmKUU5KBoRhzypjERYpYkxzBFNunKfEJ2Hx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXf6J1wgMLBmKUU5KBoRhzypjERYpYkxzBFNunKfEJ2Hx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXf6J1wgMLBmKUU5KBoRhzypjERYpYkxzBFNunKfEJ2Hx", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1fcLHgqHHcqxv8DM9PLEj1K3xyUgUJmBfz"], "tags": ["pixelart", "animation", "dream", "sweets"], "extra": {}}

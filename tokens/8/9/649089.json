This is the 13th letter of The Cool Alphabet, F Is For Frodo! I love Lord Of The Rings! I'm not sure I could really pick between LOTR, Star Wars or Harry Potter, I want them all at the same time, but I can say that I fell hardest first, for Lord Of The Rings. I had read The Hobbit in like 3rd grade but never got to the trilogy until high school and was instantly mesmerized by the fantastical quest this fellowship embarks on. Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves and Wizards, not exactly scintillating topics of conversation when it comes to the fairer sex. So was stunned when I met my wife and her and I had nearly identical taste in entertainment. Sometimes I like to think that LOTR kept me company to scare off the high maintenance snobs until I met the gal of my dreams.

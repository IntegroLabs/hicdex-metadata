My paintings are sketches for a reality that is disembodied while virtual works become material, in a continuous roleplay between the tangible and the virtual that come to influence one another. Repetitive forms become content: patterns are remodeled into new compositions aiming to find deviations from a serial order by reshaping the initial structure from regular and predictable to asymmetrical and non-repetitive. 2021 | @c_e_braileanu","tags":["painting","patterns","composition","asymmetrical","installation","lines","claudiabraileanu"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmTsZQV5PJQAEBbXVFwee34uApcD8cS5KKB1WzUB976yWZ"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTsZQV5PJQAEBbXVFwee34uApcD8cS5KKB1WzUB976yWZ","display_uri":"ipfs://QmeRPxYGtX2cYCspDBjPtoWEEMCzsDHiCpQvg1gzKaKkvi","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

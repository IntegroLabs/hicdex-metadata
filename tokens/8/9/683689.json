", "description": "The Bit's & Pieces series is an introduction to the vastness of Gion's artistic expressions. Samples were taken from 50 years of making illustrations and graphic art. Each piece represents another whole set of collections, a little taste of what is to come. \n\nThroughout his life, Gion is fascinated with the concept of philosophy, faith, and fate. Balance & Chaos is his way to represent a view about life. Square, triangle, circle stacked one upon another representing a centered geometry of life's harmony. But what happens when we are too lustful to achieve that centered perfect shapes of life? We create too many plans in life that those plans stacked upon another. In the end, creating self-designed chaos. This collaboration piece represents those idea.  \n\nBalance is drawn by hand with pencil and pen on paper. Scanned & very lightly retouched. Chaos is an exploration of the original, toyed around using software by @artbygion team.

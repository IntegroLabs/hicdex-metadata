Well first off, knowing that part of the rules are that you have to start off with two separate words and build out from there, the logical conclusion could be deduced that every word in between will be kind of random. So creating a narrative with the in between words is completely out the window; it would be utter rubbish and pretentious to do so. What we can drill down and focus on are the two initial words; this is the only aspect of control within the game. So, if we take this as a truth, we can begin to build relationships between these two words. For instance, a logical step off point for this would be to choose word opposites. In this particular experiment, it's WINTER and SUMMER. Opposites works because we're taking a specific concept, like seasons, and extracting their innate polarized nature to express their relationship. It works on so many levels with other words and concepts as well.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcBn22jdJ6acZtJPCnUXovBubcBJK5UfwVMwu1RTdk5yW", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd78k22odrMd3ntDHTLNFCktQFZrSpZzFzVqLR6j42LZB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcBn22jdJ6acZtJPCnUXovBubcBJK5UfwVMwu1RTdk5yW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

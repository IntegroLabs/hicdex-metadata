I\u2019m not sure how to say this, but this mission we\u2019ll be going on isn\u2019t like the others. It\u2019s dangerous and we may not survive. So if you trust me let\u2019s go, and try to lose my estranged brother haha!  Lunars Log: Razor has been chasing us down in his ship for a bit now. What\u2019s weird and kinda scary is that he\u2019s catching up. I\u2019m not sure if he even wants to hurt us, but his intentions don\u2019t seem like good ones. I can\u2019t believe this is from not getting any uppies as a kid. I digress, we\u2019re going to try and lose him by Markarian 501, a nearby supermassive blackhole. *End Transmission*", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPpJ6g6sRFatPyfnBz81BQKsHvJcZmjkTh66U3Go7yATf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeHX5oJbP3H8cPn3MoVtBywc8SZAiTrW5eYCccP4bBZrk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPpJ6g6sRFatPyfnBz81BQKsHvJcZmjkTh66U3Go7yATf", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fzLJbhRQSep9NgQZpdPLnCC5AGpWCTpTF"], "tags": ["scifi", "space", "astronaut", "galaxy", "universe", "alien", "blackhole", ""], "extra": {}}

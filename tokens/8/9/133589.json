I’m not sure how to say this, but this mission we’ll be going on isn’t like the others. It’s dangerous and we may not survive. So if you trust me let’s go, and try to lose my estranged brother haha!  Lunars Log: Razor has been chasing us down in his ship for a bit now. What’s weird and kinda scary is that he’s catching up. I’m not sure if he even wants to hurt us, but his intentions don’t seem like good ones. I can’t believe this is from not getting any uppies as a kid. I digress, we’re going to try and lose him by Markarian 501, a nearby supermassive blackhole. *End Transmission*","tags":["scifi","space","astronaut","galaxy","universe","alien","blackhole",""],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmPpJ6g6sRFatPyfnBz81BQKsHvJcZmjkTh66U3Go7yATf","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPpJ6g6sRFatPyfnBz81BQKsHvJcZmjkTh66U3Go7yATf","display_uri":"ipfs://QmeHX5oJbP3H8cPn3MoVtBywc8SZAiTrW5eYCccP4bBZrk","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

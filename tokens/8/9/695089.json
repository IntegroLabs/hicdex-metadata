I'm a huge toy collector and some of my favorite pieces are Japanese vinyl from companies like Real X Head, Secret Base and of course Gargamel. Today's design features a figure named \"Odoron\" or the Wave Monster from Gargamel and it is quite literally a wave. There is even a tiny ship embedded in his chest, riding said rogue wave. I love pieces like this because they take inanimate things like water or sludge and turn it into a cool, wild looking monster. These Kaiju figures were some of the first things I found when I started collecting designer vinyl toys in the early 2000s and no matter what I've expanded into like traditional action figures or Lego I always return back to these figures for inspiration.

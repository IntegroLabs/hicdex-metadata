It's gone now, taken to prop the dwindling success of Onneperial colonies. Gone too are the humans who picked at it and pulled it out.   Different humans live there now and though they still call this place Ironhold, they hold no iron. This community sustains itself on only the metal of the shovels they use when digging over their allotments.

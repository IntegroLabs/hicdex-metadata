The track is available here: https://bit.ly/NiftySax-yournumber Projects official page: https://niftysax.com/legato100 description: as a person with chronic illness, i drew on the computer my (current only) medications, and various chemicals found in the human brain and nerves. fibromyalgia takes a lot of mental and physical energy to manage while we mess with systems in my body to try and find solution that improve the symptoms. i was really happy to be a part of legato100 and you should definitely check out the 99 other works and the music, and of course big thanks to kate alexandria and niftysax for organizing and bringing in to the project!

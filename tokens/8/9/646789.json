The series is made in Photoshop CC, bootleg version, with a low-quality mouse, click by click on a ultra low performance laptop. it was important to paint with the simplest brush possible, revealing the sweet digital imperfection, like paint plasters on an oil canvas. \n\n     In this series i make automatic drawings over silhouettes of pop culture children cartoon characters. The result is an evil reflection of my childhood, a black mirror, some sort of shadow work experience. \n\nThis collection will grow over time, digging deep into the most notorious characters that shaped our infancy. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPm5aCr9h5qJy13QPLwLd1VGw4jzXhnDQFwE9W4z4mL1A", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXEF5rniWppNieLtbaPhQwNRaiRn9VBV1UbUZi9e3GA9Z", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPm5aCr9h5qJy13QPLwLd1VGw4jzXhnDQFwE9W4z4mL1A", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1M81Za4Uri5CkvpBA2xZQjaqSfAMtq6YQV"], "tags": ["evil", "black", "evilblack", "dark", "demon", "blackmirror", "shadowwork"], "extra": {}}

The conceptual artwork makes obsolete the perspective and \"vanishing point\" discussion in art history by elevating machine over human perspective on the art object. \n\nThe collection includes the original computer code, the printed images of the  geometry, a video of a 3D custom-made software, an augmented reality version of the latter, and a 3D-printed sculpture of the same object.  \n\n.jpeg\n1020x1320", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd6r3h4UvekyRJGnCZbgr6cp3DgPdtmUgeZHUvx9CwL48", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVsEqZDtC332F4H9eE5h1dzVDymvDM4Vf8WoAKbgAGkU9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd6r3h4UvekyRJGnCZbgr6cp3DgPdtmUgeZHUvx9CwL48", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TvKHXSkrdZDXjyUSRqvT2Pe5cEoS2fqET"], "tags": ["geometry", "digital", "generative", "machinic"], "extra": {}}

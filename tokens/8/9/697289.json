After many attempts, I was still able to achieve the result I wanted. And with this work, I decided to start the \"Tree Prints\" series, which I will digitalize using high-quality scanning and then turn into NFT. And first of all, I want you to print out this work and decorate your house. Thus, we will continue the amazing path of this spruce, even after its end. \n\nThis spruce was approximately 45-55 years old. The print was made on acid-free paper using linocut ink.\n\n| 6664x9152 pixels, 400 DPI |\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZcNgGx4FSkLwcNZeKPW5NN8xqNAQMxxvPdGiAENaoEe8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSDeq4RhmpuUWryjKg5feRMU2GzD1B1Q1fwwqx4PBRYUT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZcNgGx4FSkLwcNZeKPW5NN8xqNAQMxxvPdGiAENaoEe8", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NB3Pr5WYq74BkMzKGY2EZb32SqhGCG6ue"], "tags": ["tree", "print", "painting", "paint", "scan", "forest", "color", "wood", "nature", "art", "abstract", "acrylic", "paper"], "extra": {}}

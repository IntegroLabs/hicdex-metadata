This Halloween event I created the painting in brave and fear concept. The first background layer I've used my feet to run on the canvas, it likes the feeling when you want to escape from something that you scared. On the base layers I've used the dark colors like black, gray, dark blue, red crimson to represent different fear feelings. After that I've used more bright colors to represent brave feeling for covering the fears. You might see some fear that still show up but the focal point in this piece is the bright yellow color on the middle that mean this soul want you to focus on the brave more than fear inside.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYFDm8yaZt89THpcxPDsBNKtWAZ9F4jAC1opMZGH66vMD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUtw9VJt5Rn3bDGxW7KntcJvGh6om6jMKsGtMzRotLBWt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYFDm8yaZt89THpcxPDsBNKtWAZ9F4jAC1opMZGH66vMD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UyQS8mdJ8abNodDjV7bH7kDHJgKJvi5AS"], "tags": ["Abstract", "Abstractart", "Halloween", "HeanloweenTH", "Henloween"], "extra": {}}

A few days later I came back and did what I did. I suggest you evaluate. Thank you!) Here I showed up a little in the frame, but it was intentional that I draw the stars myself. This photo was taken using the light painting technique (Light painting is a long exposure technique with moving different light sources in front of the lens. You can also highlight objects or move the camera itself.) In Moscow in May 2021. Everything was done in real time in one shot without using Photoshop. Small color correction. Used a keychain flashlight. Photograph Specifications: live composite mode. | f 8 | ISO 200 | Olympus OM-D E-M1.

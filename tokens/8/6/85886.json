Firefighters, nurses, coal miners, and the many workers and civilians who sacrificed themselves attempting to mitigate the disaster should continue to be remembered as this could have eventually spread causing an even larger global catastrophe.  these type of large-scale atrocities have plighted our existence on this realm. my wish is that we can put any differences aside and bridge discord into hope.  this piece is also very inspired by the artwork of Heiko Müller (who also has a Hic Et Nunc account I’m finding out just now *yay* dude if you’re reading this i love your work so much..

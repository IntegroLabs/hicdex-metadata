From there, I searched for more vintage tapes and started the analog processing. However, a few days later, I felt that it was still a bit shallow so I started on a new research path. I began looking into Reddit themeparks and rollercoasters communities and, as a continuation of that, I joined Discord servers where I met great and passionate enthusiasts that helped me to discover lots of cool rides. It has been a great journey.\n\n800x600 // .GIF", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcW7NCSG73unixe3bYKzfhG7kMvv2oEdwVHStSKsULJPd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcW7NCSG73unixe3bYKzfhG7kMvv2oEdwVHStSKsULJPd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcW7NCSG73unixe3bYKzfhG7kMvv2oEdwVHStSKsULJPd", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Rn6tv2B8pHpDaRWUruRf2MwiGJCX3reME"], "tags": ["analog", "glitchart", "glitch", "amusementpark", ""], "extra": {}}

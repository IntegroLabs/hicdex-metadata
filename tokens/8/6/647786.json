Shenron (like other known Eternal Dragons) generally resembles a traditional four-toed Chinese dragon: brown antlers, sharp teeth, green scaly skin, red eyes, a long serpentine body of mostly tail, long flowing whiskers, a long snout, crescent-shaped nostrils, and flowing green hair on his cheeks. When Shenron is summoned, the sky becomes pitch dark, even during daytime. Whenever he is called he will arrive to grant one wish. Once he disappears, the sky returns to normal.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY6ZhBmUgktJUtHU1RQbj2Bv2NLWWPkUBYzA8tV5emmiG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP9hibHZWP8vUfviUxBCtAfTxgTNTaTLbGBV97WVXQPU8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY6ZhBmUgktJUtHU1RQbj2Bv2NLWWPkUBYzA8tV5emmiG", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WpzMEJ7VQhTRdKoNhxNrYMrjhmQaRkLP9"], "tags": ["dragon", "ball", "goku", "wish", "3d", "aftereffect", "adobe", "new", "c4d", "blender"], "extra": {}}

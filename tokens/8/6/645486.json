We have in many ways realised the potential to project our wildest dreams. Kendrick\u2019s work explores many aspects of science fiction and video games; utilising elements of collage, film and found documentary in order to explore the extended language painting as a digital endeavour.\n\nOften exploring ideas through the perspective of the machine mind, Kendrick\u2019s work invites the viewer into a world built by an imagined newly sentient digital entity. The work reflects on the nature of the network exploring the idea of copies and the contortion, collation and regurgitation of our own thoughts which, in current deep learning networks, display as convincing reflection of machine consciousness.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTJRxiy8WbhMsxbWUrPUFHgn5wJcSiUyGuv2M2HngVSwy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXNSPLvaPeh4x6HYNuHkbCzzviQFCDSbyfFx4yMJGyyoq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTJRxiy8WbhMsxbWUrPUFHgn5wJcSiUyGuv2M2HngVSwy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PZHKUhuJPg8kKevRtmKF1iYHBvCC7ZAPM"], "tags": ["art", "installation", "videoart", "sculpture", "willkendrick", "ai", "video", "jpg"], "extra": {}}

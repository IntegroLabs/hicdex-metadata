It’s an ethos for the unstable world we all live in now. As an ethos for life, it means understanding what’s really important & not giving it up. It means taking brave, smart risks and looking at the long term return. It also means hodling your nerve when people think you’re nuts. A series of 4 flavors, this one is inspired by taste memories from artists in the h=n community.","tags":["cake","food","cute","kawaii","3D","apple","caramel","green"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmUPJmAtZEdSLV1MvgsK7UZcuTQp7ScLPuXu9PU1PXdEN4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmUPJmAtZEdSLV1MvgsK7UZcuTQp7ScLPuXu9PU1PXdEN4","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNQi4cuvcjfLWwu73ozzHctSt2y8RXBJmhMXSsFFb9d9a","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

In the epic, he is the third among Pandavas, the five sons of Pandu. The family formed part of the royal line of the Kuru Kingdom. In the Mahabharata War, Arjuna was a key warrior from the Pandava side and slew many warriors including Karna. Before the beginning of the war, his mentor, Krishna, gave him the supreme knowledge of Bhagavad Gita to overcome his moral dilemmas.\n\n\nI created this character set based on several references from local and digital media. I hope you like it and waiting for some collections that I will collect slowly, enjoy.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQtJrfbmnNuwGxs8iLjEpJBmWimne9BbnXqTCfxcsVBva", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdNhcqAvnaVHXPSChNStsQJutTYbXYXAFrT1fGSZpCCgb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQtJrfbmnNuwGxs8iLjEpJBmWimne9BbnXqTCfxcsVBva", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cyNKWVMv8MdadLpWEWvijqZXSWYrcXWDZ"], "tags": ["traditionalculture", "collections", "illustrations", "puppets", ""], "extra": {}}

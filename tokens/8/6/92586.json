He said something to convey to you.. Beware of your condition when everything is so good it couldn't get any better.  This is usually followed by a black streak that remains wide for the rest of your life. This world is tied to the balance of black and white, good and bad.. Let everything be fine, but it is better when something is missing for complete bliss.   It's safer this way.","tags":["HELL","PARADISE","SAKURA","BALANCE","SUNSET","SOUL","PANDA","WHITE","PINK","BLACK"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmVydGmE3WSqSEXHR1KVR2jXVQLg31kkRYt6LrcjoCaViP"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVydGmE3WSqSEXHR1KVR2jXVQLg31kkRYt6LrcjoCaViP","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

I\u2019ve never had many \u201cthings\u201d, and money has always been scarce in my life. When I was a kid, I read everything I could. And I wrote on every piece of paper I got my hands on. Words were always free, always in supply, and they left endless possibilities of what could be created with them. I share this poem for the HENthousand challenge. I have been making crypto art since 2018. When I started, I was homeless and made art on a cellphone. In 2019, I joined superrare. As of April 2021, I am no longer homeless. Soon I will be sharing a great deal more of my writing with the crypto art community. It\u2019s who I am, and although it\u2019s not flashy, there is great worth in Words. I am way behind the curve on social Media so please if you like my poetry follow me on Twitter.com/NFTWannabe, and I will follow you too!

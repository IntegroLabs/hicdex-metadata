They do not have the same space-time existence as humans, they live in the past, present and future at the same time. This is why their advice is very precious and why wise people listen for it in quiet meditation.\n\nThe sound of their wings is crystalline and those are fragile like glass, which is why\nthey stay away from civilization and prefer to whisper to the wind that carries their advice for miles and miles.\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWpLg5gf9sbWYtR3R2mYnYju2xYqrx9eEEG611tbmGKGD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZHK6H88iRhi9WHhZDqCr4e6c2FR2EUpx9YJZ7uxZ8uj1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWpLg5gf9sbWYtR3R2mYnYju2xYqrx9eEEG611tbmGKGD", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld", "fairy", "fairies"], "extra": {}}

It's a unique environment, and I'm forever grateful a planned aluminium smelter did not get built here in the late 1970s. \n\nHeyward Point overlooks the area and affords this view of the sinuous sandspit southeast of the settlement. \n\nI love walking up there; it's high enough that you feel like a bird (or drone?) looking down through flocks of gulls soaring in the uplift from the cliffs to the surf crashing far below, but keeping your feet on the ground.\n\nSecond in a triptych of hybrid photograph/generative line art pieces from a recent wander.\n\n4000x6000px JPG\n\nAramoana, Aotearoa \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff\nPhotographed Jan 23 2022\nProcessed Jan 25 2022\n\njimmykl.tez \nhttps://jimmy.is", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWCvQhfiGqJZWmCMQEWs6qqzQggKFv1JyftPWqgsRhDB1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcVTdGfgniCsU9wpLz5qgEUa3XzGWmC5Pabq67hXTdRt7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmdP3p9xTLnKkasbHmqkavGzFW9sjqwZtzNbe5XcZL3fhN", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWCvQhfiGqJZWmCMQEWs6qqzQggKFv1JyftPWqgsRhDB1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hZ7Q55pbwK26Se2U32iLk57LH4pxGN6VE"], "tags": ["landscape", "photograph", "generative", "generativeart", "lineart", "digital", "triptych"], "extra": {}}

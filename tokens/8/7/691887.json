The planet they live in looks like a utopia of planet Earth, but some things do not apply, like physics forces, they seem to be able to fly, or even walk up on walls. What is also curious is that there is no presumption of differences between gender. Some believe that the spikes over their bodies can eventually appear, maybe for protection, or as reactions, or to feel exuberant. One thing is really intriguing for humans, these creatures seem to live in total peace.\"\n-/incrypted message/-\n\nThis piece is airdroped for collectors of all 4 pieces in the series \"The Explorer I\".

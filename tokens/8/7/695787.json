{"__version": 1, "token_id": 695787, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Original sound of the Big Bang", "description": "This sound recording of the Big Bang was created by physicist John G. Cramer. Dr. Cramer used the measurement data of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from ESA's Planck space telescope and converted the energy frequencies into audible sound. The recording represents the sound from about 380,000 years after the Big Bang until about 760,000 years after the Big Bang. The funds collected from this project will be donated to K-12 STEM Grants providing better education and resources for children.

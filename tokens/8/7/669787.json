{"__version": 1, "token_id": 669787, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Hobohemia 2", "description": "Lately I've been reading about Hobo, listening to Bob Dylan, Jack Elliott, to Woody Guthrie, and also some of Walt Whitman's poems, I've been imagining the life and adventures of being Hobo in the past, doing art, making unique codes, which may now be known as semiotics, until finally making this as a form of admiration for their way of 'life' and the philosophy they hold during 'traveling'. I plan to make a series about hobo, maybe later there will be 3 to 4 illustrations with a limited edition. Hoboes move across the country by hopping onto trains, but crucially they work for their living, reading poetry, making art, networking, performing seasonal labor and taking on odd jobs and rejects the perceived banality of middle-class existence for a life of adventure, albeit one often marred by danger, poverty and sadness. \u201cBeing on the road, hopping on a newly extensive network of trains to find work and see the world, living spontaneously and confronting a myriad of incidents every day, is living fully and creatively where one cannot count on routine to survive, having the audacity to live reckless and free in order to live a life in technicolor brilliance. There\u2019s adventure, camaraderie, creativity, philosophy and joy, but still hoboes simply are inseparable from danger, instability and terror. I hope we can all keep moving and doing something fun.

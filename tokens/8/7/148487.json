My take on the story of the temptation of St.Anthony, which goes something like, this first he was tested by the devil with physical lust which he overcame, apparantley by demasculating himself, he was then visited by demons who beat him. After this he went into isolation in an abandoned roman fort, when he emerged people were surprised to find him sane and enlightened. A good motif to go to town on the demonoids and interperate them my way as well as adding intricate detailing.

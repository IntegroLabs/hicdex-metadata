I do try to switch up the works, but sometimes folks you have to keep going down that one street just to see where it ends. Thankfully, we have a new found area of exploration for our journey; word ladders. Word ladders are puzzles that begin with two words. To solve the puzzle, one must find a chain of other words to link the two, in which two adjacent words (that is, words in successive steps) differ by one letter. Word ladders aren't new at all, in fact Lewis Carroll invented/discovered them on Christmas Day in 1877. I wanted to experiment with this illusive sub-genre of wordplay. The results you'll see have created somewhat of an obsession for me. There are various levels of difficulty within these ladders. 1. Length of the words (3 letter words are easy to shift around because of the lack of possibilities. The longer the words, the more difficult the operations become.) I decided to chose two random words on this to experiment with only one letter they share in the same spot \"O\". It took 11 jumps to get from TOMB to DORK. As we go down the ladder we're just replacing one letter. What are the possibilities from this game? Can we create an actual narrative from a word ladder?

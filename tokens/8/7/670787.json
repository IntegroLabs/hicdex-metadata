{"__version": 1, "token_id": 670787, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Athena", "description": "Athena or Athene, often given the epithet Pallas, is an ancient Greek goddess associated with wisdom, handicraft, and warfarewho was later syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva. Athena was regarded as the patron and protectress of various cities across Greece, particularly the city of Athens, from which she most likely received her name. The Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens is dedicated to her. Her major symbols include owls, olive trees, snakes, and the Gorgoneion. In art, she is generally depicted wearing a helmet and holding a spear.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Athena was believed to have been born from the forehead of her father Zeus. In some versions of the story, Athena has no mother and is born from Zeus' forehead by parthenogenesis. In others, such as Hesiod's Theogony, Zeus swallows his consort Metis, who was pregnant with Athena; in this version, Athena is first born within Zeus and then escapes from his body through his forehead. .Athena was the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; she was believed to have aided the heroes Perseus, Heracles, Bellerophon, and Jason. Along with Aphrodite and Hera, Athena was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the Trojan War.\n\nSince the Renaissance, Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and classical learning. Western artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of freedom and democracy.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdVey2H1mY5sjaLvQwXQmWRVajo4UN2Da9iqe4cm5c9XA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQnCXX3X6hiijkNVXn1Uo25gJyrW6zNAerPTG3jDJJ7oP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdVey2H1mY5sjaLvQwXQmWRVajo4UN2Da9iqe4cm5c9XA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SwFwV4iAus6m6j2NN1v1mrUuZFvreVCpZ"], "tags": ["statue", "antalya", "turkey", "photography", "photo", "ancient", "city", "old", "rome", "history", "mythology", "hero", "strong", "god", "war", "freedom", "democracy"], "extra": {}}

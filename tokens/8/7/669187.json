The first of a series. \n\nFortraits 1\n\nYorgie knows what it is to be without a home. He\u2019s seen some rough times. Gone are his days and nights of scrubbing the greasy vents in the tannery behind the gas station. After which he\u2019d creep off to his corner in the damp alley, for another fitful night's sleep under the tarp. Listening to the rain. Having ultimately prevailed when many around him thought for sure he was done, he\u2019s in a much better place. The fact that his new fortress is a bit cramped doesn\u2019t bother him in the slightest. Perfection is rare and fleeting. The realms of gratitude and compassion - that\u2019s where the magic is. And that\u2019s where our man now resides. He feels alive for the first time. \n\n@kellybrnz\n1700 x 1700 150 ppi. @kellybrnz Thank you!

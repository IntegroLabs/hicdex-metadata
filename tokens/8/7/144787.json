An exploration of tension and form, 14 brush strokes and 7 circles with a bias toward grouping and intersection. I wanted to find a generative way to build dynamic compositions in a 3D space that ultimately appeared to be 2D painting - a painting that would not have appeared too out of place in an abstract expressionist gallery. I took heavy inspiration from the works of artists Kandinsky and van Doesburg. I also found excitement and strength in chasing the deliberate intention of a kanji stroke. The formation machine allows me to take numbers meaningful to me and galvanize and commemorate them with a composition that will always be tied to that meaning.\u00a0", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd3Hxoveu6EL6Q9duccgLHMhPfBoutp5booMo6kDSN4MW", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd3Hxoveu6EL6Q9duccgLHMhPfBoutp5booMo6kDSN4MW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd3Hxoveu6EL6Q9duccgLHMhPfBoutp5booMo6kDSN4MW", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1MkgiALg5Z3q6jZBiEcda2Beq3nG6Ca62U"], "tags": ["Fubby14", "formations", "generative", "Procedural", "Coding", "2D", "3d", "Iterativeart", "abstract", "14"], "extra": {}}

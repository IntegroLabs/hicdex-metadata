Flyin' High is a machinima about the connections between the environmental crisis, the Internet and world aviation. Filmed in Microsoft Flight Simulator, it is the recording of a whole flight from Milan to Rome, lasting almost an hour. When Cryptoart became synonymous with speculation, its critics denounced the high environmental impact of NFT art. One of the most recurring parallels appearing on newspapers and social media was that minting an NFR generated about 90Kg of CO2, corresponding more or less to flying a jetliner for an hour. During the pandemic, airplanes embodied wealth and freedom, while digital worlds were increasingly becoming an essential part of our lives.

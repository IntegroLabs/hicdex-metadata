People called other local users as you had to pay more for long-distance calls. They said it felt like teleporting into someone else's computer. It was invented during a Chicago blizzard in 1978 when some friends couldn't meet up for their computer club, so they figured out how to meet with the computers. Some of these BBS's are still accessible using internet-assisted tools but I reckon it doesn't feel the same. This is an analog message I digitally processed multiple times but still don't know what the fuck it says.

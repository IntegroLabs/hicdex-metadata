I made the mistake of going to a church service while visiting my aunt that I was warned was \u201ca little weird\u201d. After witnessing violent crying on the floor in a hand-holding prayer circle, my 11-year-old self ended up in the Sunday school admitting I didn\u2019t pray and was met with being touched by everyone there on the shoulders speaking in tongue. Children and adults - I didn't know anyone in the room at all. It was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I\u2019ve had and I remember it vividly still to this day. I wanted to finally illustrate how that experience made me feel and how religion as a whole is not for me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeJdqKZ673mnGpATSMp7LKbKjVDaxVv2hsvnLG9312cyR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUEECtwWdPJcDqHC3khjKGUwzaxUSAc1q2Hso7MG34b3c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmWbG7hCtiHSFHNP2bX1ViqpoD3Fa7RpTfPcXbsJ5LPwd1", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeJdqKZ673mnGpATSMp7LKbKjVDaxVv2hsvnLG9312cyR", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1gADRowRshmxVnXgLRBWU9aH2gvDKc2tLC"], "tags": ["religion", "illustration", "digital", "dark", "symbolic", "surreal", "graphic", "digitalpainting"], "extra": {}}

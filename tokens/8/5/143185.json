He was an exceptionally brilliant airbrush artist active 81-97 specializing in large scale murals in my childhood home the foyer had 20ft ceilings and I remember waking up one night to him dangling from where the chandelier should have been painting away to Bad Company. That mural was called \"Falling Angels\"  depicted Michael casting Lucifer out of Heaven, he later went on to complete 100s of pieces in homes, businesses,RV's, churches, schools and ballparks across the US. Before that my father was a AH-1 Helicopter mechanic & MP at Feucht Army Airbase in Nuremberg, Germany until its closure. He always use to tell me \"Take every chance you can, make mistakes, fall down! But get back up, dust yourself, learn from your mistake & keep moving forward.\" He was big on never settling when we are meant to constantly grow.

{"__version":1,"extra":{"display_uris":[]},"token_id":86285,"symbol":"OBJKT","creators":["tz1TWTDBFt46qtFLGWekZiJUGRbm8TRgFvVn"],"name":"Ouroboros","description":"The Ouroboros represents the perpetual cyclic renewal of life and infinity, the concept of eternity and the eternal return, and represents the cycle of life, death and rebirth leading to immortality, as in the Phoenix. The current mathematical symbol for infinity may be derived from a variant on the classic Ouroboros with the snake looped once before eating its own tail. This sculpture exists in both digital and physical forms and was created using 3D scanning of a live model.

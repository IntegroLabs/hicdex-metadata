A character of great reverence and virtue.\n\nThis stoic and lonesome creature travels through time and space using a device known as the Biliel Terminus. A mix between life and death, nature and machine. It's goal is to find a place to relax and call it's home, somewhere between light and darkness. Biliel as it has become to be known is a generous soul who is friendly and offers a unique insight into things seen and unseen. A ying-yang of chaos and order is always something on Biliels mind as it reaches further out into the disorder of the the haze. An area of unexplored universe that has no known physics. Its body colour is the most neon green and red mixed with lots of strange patterns and paisley garments. Biliel is truly a marvelous character. \n\n1000 Editions maximum", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUqhuPcJUUbPxKnzg9Scg57epegcjXcUtzwsLsYLre1F6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUqhuPcJUUbPxKnzg9Scg57epegcjXcUtzwsLsYLre1F6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUqhuPcJUUbPxKnzg9Scg57epegcjXcUtzwsLsYLre1F6", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1XGzUa2VeMr8nqzVGHhtGG7UU4uRgWHVTM"], "tags": ["animated", "alien", "extraterrestrial", "visitor", "nebula", "sentient", "sentience", "life", "characters"], "extra": {}}

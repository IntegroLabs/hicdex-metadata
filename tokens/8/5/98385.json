(newspaper columns)","description":"The writing exercise of 1 to 3 newspaper columns per week not exceeding 15 lines, faxed each week to chief editors of the L'Est RÃ©publicain newspaper (from January 24, 2004 to April 21, 2005) where I was a local press correspondent for a while.  Never published: 'not sales-orientated enough for a local newspaper that wants, hears talking about people by name' said the publication editors. I continued to write these columns during the other 8 months after their refusal, continuing to fax them to the editorial staff. Language: only in french. Number of columns: 41. PDF: 44 pages.","tags":["lenieblue","PDF","french","columns","workingclass","newspaper","newscolumms","writing","writer","shortstory","tale","democracy","citizenship","citizen"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"application/pdf","uri":"ipfs://QmRgzGy3DCq2yok1eBthu99L9yQt2m5RXbvUxDRyTFFuxT"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmRgzGy3DCq2yok1eBthu99L9yQt2m5RXbvUxDRyTFFuxT","display_uri":"ipfs://QmekPnJ8WnrFngazsSQ3yYm1gXQWNGt1Dc5qobCBY6ok6f","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

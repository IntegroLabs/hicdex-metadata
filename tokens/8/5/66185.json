A remake of the classic snake game in pure ASCII by Sabin Timalsena (Lumic). I created an ASCII renderer on top of p5js, so that I could program the game using 9x16 character fonts like in MS-DOS days. This is very symbolic for me, because I made this same ASCII game in DOS/QBasic in high school, when I had first fallen in love with programming. Creating this game is like time traveling for me, and I am right back at my roots.","tags":["interactive","game","snake","ASCII","pixel","DOS","retro","colorful"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"application/x-directory","uri":"ipfs://QmXFHVEEJBzzrAB3QMroBycUNHFGCZQaDXkCu6RB2Knc8y"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXFHVEEJBzzrAB3QMroBycUNHFGCZQaDXkCu6RB2Knc8y","display_uri":"ipfs://Qmac5fLKg5pF2bdGPsz8hNPrBK47S2cFDvWXqwRjaSFYZf","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

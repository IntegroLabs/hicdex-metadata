{"__version": 1, "token_id": 652585, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Good Snake", "description": "ou must have social proofs from one of the Tezos identity services. The more proofs you have, the more likely you will have the option to be verified, as Versum is constantly monitoring these services and updating its allow list. To get your social proofs, update your profile in one of the Tezos identity managers (Tezos Profiles, TZKT, SUBJKT, or TezID). Versum looks at TezosProfiles first, so at least do that one, and add as many proofs as you're comfortable with.\n\nOnce you have done this, an on-chain verification button will appear in Settings -> Account in your Versum profile. This will trigger a wallet dialogue and we will write your verification status to the blockchain. After that, you will have unrestricted access to all of Versum's features.\n\na good snake meets a baby lion, misunderstood, actually a baby lion is afraid of him Lol:)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma93wx7wUDRnSzBcTTsv1UJT6DbUgkqhkUrFokGFS73kZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbdsVLRFfw9L87VwD5Rt2s7hQJGr9EiUdRUmGZbxxbtLW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma93wx7wUDRnSzBcTTsv1UJT6DbUgkqhkUrFokGFS73kZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1h2AAZBc5B3MxhzeBRZ53Aq4X4BRiXnehJ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "illustration", "story", "handdrawn", "cartoon", "comic"], "extra": {}}

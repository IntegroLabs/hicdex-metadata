Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, Silent Hill, Metal Slug, Crash, and others are games that sparked my passion for video games, a passion that continues to this day.\nI never had a PS1 at home, I always dreamed of writing my name on a memory card and being able to play whenever I want. And today, 18 years later, every time I think about those days when playing was the only thing that mattered, it brings me a beautiful nostalgia, so I allow myself to go back in time for just a little while, and give myself the treat I always wanted as a child, write my name on the memory card.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVwQedaceZbXH7Hy9EMs6WtTfDsSqmL46tu9z9jsEssEQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRfkJS3DNU542QR8ouLxSJw5WrLcJsQr2hQ9YWVjF5yeg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVwQedaceZbXH7Hy9EMs6WtTfDsSqmL46tu9z9jsEssEQ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1afXNKCeyAEE852tgxj4E1UGcg5beaiChh"], "tags": ["voxel", "ps1", "videogames", "playstation", "nft", "digitalart", "pixelart", "voxelart", "argentina", "3dpixelart", "3d"], "extra": {}}

On my trip to beautiful Vietnam, a cute little girl from a poor family wore a shiny Mickey Mouse ears hat and her mother was selling flowers, The little girl was drawing shapes on the floor with her finger, She had no idea about Mickey Mouse and the glamor of the disney world World.\n\n\nThat paradox led me to draw pictures of girls in glossy Mickey Mouse ears hat in my sketchbook ,That collection has always inspired me and now I would like to experience that in another way in the digital world.\nI chose the character names from the Walt Disney characters with or without any purpose.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYLRPxSGSNhWcJR35CnwS6Fy61QWfySdKTK92WQTGLv8u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYLRPxSGSNhWcJR35CnwS6Fy61QWfySdKTK92WQTGLv8u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYLRPxSGSNhWcJR35CnwS6Fy61QWfySdKTK92WQTGLv8u", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WEeRXtK5HH2Gay3qRFHKh36GWgj7LAWwC"], "tags": ["digitalillustration", "mickeymouse", "waltdisney", "motion", "pixelart", "woman"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 396585, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "5W+1H", "description": "There are basic questions we all ask on daily basis to gain perspective of our lives and environment. We all learn them at some point in school. WHO/WHAT/WHERE/WHEN/WHY/HOW - We use these questions to gain truths of our separate and shared realities to make them predictable and understandable. Imagine not being able to answer specific questions about our immediate environments. Our minds would probably start playing tricks on us to create the narrative and fill in the information void with some sort of story. We are story making machines and whether you like it or not, we're programmed to make sense of what's happening around us; all the time. It helps us to stay alive. The 5W+1H questions help us gain inductive reasoning from scanning our environment to then pivot, cogitate, and deductively make decisions to react to the stimulus. By placing the basic questions sideways we create almost a funnel or hourglass shape. This can be seen as the inductive/deductive inflection point; observation/reaction; consciousness that is steadily distilling moments of time and packets of various sensory information and weaving them into the tapestry of our lives.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeYNiovMT7KhYadbj8MeYjkTgwndmX762BAmouUrnSC2d", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcTEvTQAv93o8Kzj9piRmEUQz7mD5kuQULzePXR72mVCe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeYNiovMT7KhYadbj8MeYjkTgwndmX762BAmouUrnSC2d", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

Seems fitting with all the talk of Elon Musk's \"contributions\", (more like personal investments) to humanity, to create such a work to illustrate why his mind belongs in this era. His mind / drive / innovation / ego will push us further into the future. One could say we're in the Elon Eon, but that would be simply fanboying the flames of phantasmal fanaticism. There are many things I admire about him and things that are problematic. He's human and thus has his foibles. (Gee...Andrew, you're talking a whole lot about Elon and nothing about the artwork, wanna get to the point? We've been reading this insane book for months now.) Well, he and the work are intertwined. He's such an interesting human to not talk about, but to elate your qualms I will talk more about the work itself. When we look into mandala, we can see the subtle beauty of how everything overlaps except for the \"O\" on the outside. For me, I see an atom with electron rings whizzing about or a planet with levels of atmosphere above it. As said, in an early page, \"Space is a place where particles embrace.\" and it still rings true.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcFWdfUGjdwhagXSFwx5N9NcEEHnQZ42bssEd8B4z3jcz", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc37cCurY7gfg3Tw7E5VBeutgiwWUzFjDc6pydbGBTB5L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcFWdfUGjdwhagXSFwx5N9NcEEHnQZ42bssEd8B4z3jcz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

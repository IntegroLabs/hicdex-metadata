The WALNUT STREET parody depicts a KREEP dancing in Koko's style but in a different setting. Portraits of TOMORROWMAN and UNCLE MASON can be found in the background on the wall. \"KOKO THE KREEP\" was traditionally hand-drawn and later color and other background elements were done in Photoshop. This is a TOMORROWMAN original artwork.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPSnLhftrLmf3JAnTA9NbsVduR51Yb5nvzMXB4TtMoa2n", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXVebUKZhKJzWnykYwznWJfbZSJeEskoK6LoTJNSaC35q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPSnLhftrLmf3JAnTA9NbsVduR51Yb5nvzMXB4TtMoa2n", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dGaXCiAsKKURqRsTa6VLQZ1thrfxev3rD"], "tags": ["TOMORROWMAN", "TOMO", "PSYCHEDELIC", "TRIPPY", "INDIE", "ILLUSTRATION", "DIGITALART", "WALNUTSTREET"], "extra": {}}

The WALNUT STREET parody depicts a KREEP dancing in Koko's style but in a different setting. Portraits of TOMORROWMAN and UNCLE MASON can be found in the background on the wall. \"KOKO THE KREEP\" was traditionally hand-drawn and later color and other background elements were done in Photoshop. This is a TOMORROWMAN original artwork.","tags":["TOMORROWMAN","TOMO","PSYCHEDELIC","TRIPPY","INDIE","ILLUSTRATION","DIGITALART","WALNUTSTREET"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmPSnLhftrLmf3JAnTA9NbsVduR51Yb5nvzMXB4TtMoa2n","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPSnLhftrLmf3JAnTA9NbsVduR51Yb5nvzMXB4TtMoa2n","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXVebUKZhKJzWnykYwznWJfbZSJeEskoK6LoTJNSaC35q","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

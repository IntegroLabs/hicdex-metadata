Instead of starting out from top to bottom, our journey begins from the bottom up. The letter \"i\" began in my mind's eye and rapidly reached out in all directions like vast Dutch windmill arms. Letters gravitated inwards. I became IT, which became SIT, SPIT, etc. Like a vortex of a soul, inwardly bound and eternal. All the pieces fell perfectly into place, perplexing my particular perspective. Sometimes I wonder if I truly am the creator of these or am I like an archeologist unearthing lost artifacts. Either way, these words exist independent of extraction and/or interaction.

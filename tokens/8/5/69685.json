Usually invisible to humans, a telltale sign of the presence of a Kapre is the thick stench emanating from the giant cigar they are constantly smoking. Kapre are not necessarily evil, but they often like to play tricks on humans. If you find yourself stuck in the wilderness, hopelessly going around in circles, then you may be an unwitting victim of a Kapre's prank. To escape its control, you must remove your clothing, and wear it inside-out.","tags":["Kapre","aswang","cryptid","monster","creature","mythology","myth","Philippines","Filipino","Pilipino","Pinoy","black","dark","illustration","digital"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmbCubnwrTC79JjjBczpGZfvPSPS5mgyRUXRRhpqSF6GVZ"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbCubnwrTC79JjjBczpGZfvPSPS5mgyRUXRRhpqSF6GVZ","display_uri":"ipfs://QmerQVw2NVV8p5WAiDhrVK4Q6VxaGuCgyQqbfifzbjBhqR","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

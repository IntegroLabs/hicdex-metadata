{"__version": 1, "token_id": 656985, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Ulu Paung", "description": "In Batak Toba, one of the tribes in North Sumatra, Indonesia, \"Ulu Paung\" is a name of a carved ornament on wood, which is called \"Gorga\" in Bataknese. It is in the form of a giant creature, half human and half animal, often found in the form of a buffalo horned head. It is placed at the top of the Batak Toba traditional house and was interpreted as a symbol of shelter or protection and strength.\n\nThe statues behind Ulu Paung called \"Pangulubalang\u201d, a stone statue used by the Bataknese as a village's guardian. In ancient times, Pangulubalang was filled with spirit and mystical powers, which would alert the villagers if there were enemies threats, disasters, disease outbreaks, etc.\n\nI made these editions with a hope that my fellow artists and collectors would find protection and strength in these times of pandemic.\n\nDigital illustration with Procreate and Ai, 2022", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXLKHVFmFtXsJxUbkjpjjUvfYgjLSU3BW6m3TpUszSJ7D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWUDvPHCcVqyeJRpiS5mFmsYFwpDuMbMVxL5nyWbYU5yd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXLKHVFmFtXsJxUbkjpjjUvfYgjLSU3BW6m3TpUszSJ7D", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SVa9K2GZCK6TBUq22YvgMx9aEyVoBwiQi"], "tags": ["ulupaung", "pangulubalang", "gorga", "batak", "bataknese", "culture", "illustration", "bnw", "blackandwhite", "dark", "smoke"], "extra": {}}

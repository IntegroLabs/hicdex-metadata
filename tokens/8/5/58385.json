How long has it been since I felt? As we fight, I’ve become enthralled by this dream. Digging up my bones, leaving it out for you. And our eyes lock, filling my hollowed being.

And the bitter taste of plastic fades, when the morning comes.","tags":["Digital","Illustration"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://Qmbk4RKx4LLkWAQM3Y9DDqKwwMFHCoJCBaAd8M9MUkjG2Y"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmbk4RKx4LLkWAQM3Y9DDqKwwMFHCoJCBaAd8M9MUkjG2Y","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTcu1UXRZLwEL5YPtBpUQctdr4ZS4eCcbmYD2XHbh4f8P","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

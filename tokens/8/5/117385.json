The idea is that a car consists of separate elements: a capsule - a car body and two electric motorcycles that are joined with the body forming a single whole. Electric motorcycles are the driving force of this car, they have artificial intelligence and can move independently. The electric motorcycle can also be operated as a separate mode of transport.

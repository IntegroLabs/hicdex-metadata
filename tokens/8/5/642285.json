{"__version": 1, "token_id": 642285, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BLING", "description": "Consciousness is like a steady drip of the ego; like an endless stream of \"i\"s falling passed the sentient line of waking life and begin to seemingly command the senses towards the folly of control. Like Descartes said, \"I think, therefore I am.\"; his words echo truth. We are more than our sum of particles. We are more than the duration that life gifts us. We are all miracles for the sheer virtue that we are all alive. Not so much for the life part per se (as we see on Planet Earth life is abundant), but for consciousness itself. Is consciousness unique to humans? Are dogs, cats, horse, whales, elephants, dolphins, etc. conscious? They sure act like they know what's going on to a certain extent. If consciousness isn't unique, then what makes us unique to the animal kingdom? Our skills of rational thought? Octopuses have shown extraordinary skills of rationality. Are they on the same level as us? Obviously not, but from that moment we are conscious, our lives begin to take shape; our life's journey. What's your bling? What makes you, you?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWw7ifcWTXwsVLQ9fyJbULd2qL9keuuWFKoABusLjs6zu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQo7aS2SM3SmruXaiYstMA6gqYgpW2ksMSTb9Fvte5Wgr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWw7ifcWTXwsVLQ9fyJbULd2qL9keuuWFKoABusLjs6zu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

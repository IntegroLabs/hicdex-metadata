Is an absurd, expensive, disturbing, but beautiful and exciting journey. This trip is a Voroni diagram, 4000 polygons, 842 photos, 1MB per plane, 112,112 coordinate lines. All travel to space is nonsense. But we all want to travel to Mars. Space travel is our future salvation. We know that when we destroy this planet, when it is exhausted, we can do the same with another.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaB4AThWZ6heHuSix1heedNGvJHvRpGKDBhSf7hMXJMS2","display_uri":"ipfs://QmQhDS5yMJJA2WdsutxkywhSo3zibqjyzGbDXHZ4vWs1zB","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1PjVxUvAwJVN6gMg1633CkchdfCTwWZzj1"],"tags":["MARS","VORONOI","HIRISE","NASA","P5JS"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"application/x-directory","uri":"ipfs://QmaB4AThWZ6heHuSix1heedNGvJHvRpGKDBhSf7hMXJMS2"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmbZkxiWEoHqAX5dtEgoKxrHaY3fepdSAiwMeYAx1vHRRH"},"supply":"10","transfered":10}

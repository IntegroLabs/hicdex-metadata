I had seemed to forgotten that taking up space and being impactful+unashamed in my presence is something i deserve. Immediately i categorise as that queer-black-woman ; unfortunately society tends to not permit 'my kind' to fill spaces and take up room. We cant radiate our inherant divinity for this is too harsh and striking. But the article reminded me to take up space wonderfully. In the artwork i set out to convey this image! Symbolically expressing the cosmic divinity of the black boddy & voice, and quite literally TAKING UP SPACE!! ðŸ’«hope you love this piece! | Twitter>> @unicornvoodou | AllLinks>> https://www.linktr.ee/hkte | Dimensions: 1000 x 667 pixels; 300dpi ","tags":["Collage","composite","trippy","space","spaceart","galaxy","planets","cosmoc","pocart","political","social","activism","love","media","photoshop",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmaEJbGj7iCngtK3KGhU4dKDG7RfQw42b4pthiNoySpikD"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaEJbGj7iCngtK3KGhU4dKDG7RfQw42b4pthiNoySpikD","display_uri":"ipfs://QmaEJbGj7iCngtK3KGhU4dKDG7RfQw42b4pthiNoySpikD","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

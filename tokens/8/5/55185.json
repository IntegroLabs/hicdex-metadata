In the song I sample a voice note I recorded of myself yelling “I Don’t Care About Shit That I Can’t Stay In Control Of” during an anxiety attack in 2019. After sharing the song with Tara at the beginning of 2020, she sent me this animatic as a lyric video pitch and we went with it. Care about the things you can control and don’t stress about what you cannot.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmY3k9FZ4BQmsZcHBgoN3ZQAQ3B5AjctStbQ2J6NBboGbp","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1hTKmD8wnMftcSgxPrcCFGVYeLtGujGTR1"],"tags":["music","heno","datb","yosefgebre","moves","animatic"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmY3k9FZ4BQmsZcHBgoN3ZQAQ3B5AjctStbQ2J6NBboGbp"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmcF4632hrAibKs8GeGHHaowBLAN4muqbjH51rEENhpEvL"},"supply":"5","transfered":1}

He's currently studying the tidal force of the subsatellite, Oberon, which somehow was pulled into the forces of Titania. Titania being the largest moon in the uranian system, has enveloped all of the gravitational pull and has forced Oberon, the second largest moon, into its orbit. There's no logical explanation for this occurrence as its simply not possible. Oberon and Titania having such mass, would destroy one another in a astronomical game of tug of war. Something is causing this phenomena. Or perhaps, someone and our traveler is going to get to the bottom of it. for #HENthousand", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYNxzkBW4cMBfYcqCNEniuWpucVtTyXKrse2CHQRzoR26", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXiDFJ74p27eF2M8gZq8YVPqQ4rJM8fUroYubrjbErHzU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYNxzkBW4cMBfYcqCNEniuWpucVtTyXKrse2CHQRzoR26", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MiCzJaWi9rFsZrei3mVUbEJZi3BbrJPGf"], "tags": ["ENVIRONMENT", "COLLECTIBLE", "3D", "NFT", "LANDSCAPE", "ART", "BLENDER", "VENUS", "PLANET", ""], "extra": {}}

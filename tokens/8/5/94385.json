This artwork open new collection called: Inkedart Collection. Nomadic, untethered, wandering, self-sufficient, off-the-grid, free-spirited traveler. The original gypsies came from northern India and Egypt. They were a nomadic group who lived on and worked the land to make a living on only what was available to them. This nomadic life required extraordinary creativity and intelligence in order to survive. It is believed that they traveled to Europe somewhere around the 14th century, and over the next six centuries, they would migrate all over the world.","tags":["gypsy","tattoo","popart","tattoo","inkedart","drawing"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmbjuumnyMTaXeWYNHve7EEYcqBmR4B6QxASUcBBpJm2LK"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbjuumnyMTaXeWYNHve7EEYcqBmR4B6QxASUcBBpJm2LK","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbZmvybxoN23dY4QLYJoBPJHDPsasLzbdA7rpJzmiCoux","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

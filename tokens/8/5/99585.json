This specific weekend Toronto was hosting a mix of celebrities, athletes, and musicians for some of the biggest events. During a private afterparty I was approached by Lebron's Manager and told \"He doesn't normal let people take pictures of him, but he has asked if you could shoot a few for him\". The view down the lenses of my camera is one that I will never forget, it was almost as if I was face to face with a cardboard cut out, instead it was the legend himself. - Gabriel Di Sante","tags":["nba","lebron","kingjames","gabrieldisante","toronto","torontophotographer"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmX8trE5aHh4PZks3J62yHU9Gqb18zkXzDR4vjQ7QoYMuB"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmX8trE5aHh4PZks3J62yHU9Gqb18zkXzDR4vjQ7QoYMuB","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTstVH6TLf2f3iaxvTGeYxLANDnv5SQ3VwDMm82jkFVmE","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

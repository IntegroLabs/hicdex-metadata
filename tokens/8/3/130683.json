According to online sources, Sour Diesel gained prominence in New York in the mid-90s when breeder AJ (short for A**hole Joe,) accidentally pollinated a Chemdog 91 female with pollen from a Super Skunk he acquired during a trip to Amsterdam. The end result, Sour Diesel, was reportedly named for the way it soured business relationships as it spread through New Yorkâ€™s underground cannabis market, causing rifts as it changed hands among growers. - Weed Maps ","tags":["sourd","sourdiesel","skull","fire","flames","green","cyan","pixelsorting","loop",""],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmdXXhLAgZr6fRXGpzd71Gv8CWpp9URVMNJoCnGTT46Swh","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdXXhLAgZr6fRXGpzd71Gv8CWpp9URVMNJoCnGTT46Swh","display_uri":"ipfs://QmYW1g7E9tYWw6wMYeS5G5WcrE9msRiSd6uyZLpA5hYtZu","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

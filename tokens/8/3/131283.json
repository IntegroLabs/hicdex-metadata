The smol was the first of the Dead God SI units to be defined by a crypto-physical artefact. The smol is now defined in terms of the second, the Planck length, and anomaly-observer interaction rate, basing it on mostly-fixed fundamental constants of nature. This allows a properly-equipped metrology laboratory to calibrate a DGP measurement instrument such as a Pico8 sensory-neomodulator as the primary standard to determine an exact smol intensity, although the IPKGP and other precision smol intensities remain in use as secondary standards for all ordinary purposes.","tags":["smol","gif","loop"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmSyDVUXTaorsy3RbbWqYQ4uU8frmadR36j7UbV7o7X8a3","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSyDVUXTaorsy3RbbWqYQ4uU8frmadR36j7UbV7o7X8a3","display_uri":"ipfs://QmSyDVUXTaorsy3RbbWqYQ4uU8frmadR36j7UbV7o7X8a3","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

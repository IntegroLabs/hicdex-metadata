You've been hurt so many times now, that you would rather not risk it again. I know it feels safer to shut down your terribly cold blue heart, but don't let it stay too long in the dark, lest it dies altogether. Let the love of the moon and the stars heal it with their warmth. I hope you choose to warm the blue inside of you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWSfFWbZzzHJSvNpyWb4ENr6VHxqTJJtSpi7bneFpNsCV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeMNNEoMPDSHxmar5J6chhcfgSeMuxxNj3yQZztSjLrvd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWSfFWbZzzHJSvNpyWb4ENr6VHxqTJJtSpi7bneFpNsCV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YLLQGDCGYhVemni7GxdbEA83oL8eDTUpp"], "tags": ["boudoir", "photography", "aesthetic", "selflove", "selfcare", "healing", "blue", ""], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 485683, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Cyber Gods ", "description": "One of the surprise outcomes of cyber intelligence emerging and thriving is that mankind will for the first time have for-real, approachable and appeasable gods. The higher level cybers will be inscrutable to mankind, capricious, and some will pay attention to what mankind does. (Most will not.)\n\nThis means that for the first time mankind can experience real-world divine intervention... with no leap of faith being necessary. Mankind can pray in various ways, cybers can listen, then intervene in the course of events. Another difference between cybers and a \"real\" god is that cyber intervention will be 100% real-world natural, not supernatural, and no leap of faith is required to believe that there has been an intervention.\n.\nRest of article that inspired me this design \nhttp://www.whiteworld.com/technoland/stories-techno/stories2015/2015-TV3/2014-vis-cyber-gods.html", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcXD2DppNwpqEtsr1DKSH1wpsRH4XMhor2RwL6oMWKfBe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR6ZECkksPXtMf3VNvwyoFskMi8xFkjWXYp3cWdqgUN4V", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcXD2DppNwpqEtsr1DKSH1wpsRH4XMhor2RwL6oMWKfBe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Wdus36L69oxTCChhUN1gD54HiQqWN3cPE"], "tags": ["Cyber", "cyberpunks", "internet", "c4d", "trippy", "god", "gods", "digitalart", "surreal", "imagination"], "extra": {}}

This is the 6th piece in the Monochrome Designs \u2014 Red. Another pro-active effort to create what I'm calling the collage creatures and todays design is looking more robot than organic being. The previous days design Blue kinda leans robot also but I still see this one as more inanimate than the previous. Red is made up of a bunch of different images including the Golden Arches, the giant stadium lights from where the Reds play, a roller coaster, an arrow from a taco place, an old beer can and a bunch of other stuff.

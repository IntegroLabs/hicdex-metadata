  "description": "Critique of the immediate endless repetitive online self curation consumption production culture we live within, as fetishized by Hans Ulrich Obrist and relentlessly exploited by social media advertising companies. Artwork created with minimal thought while under extreme stress. To engage with the work as the artist intends, view this work in a feed of content, and spend as little time as possible contemplating it.",

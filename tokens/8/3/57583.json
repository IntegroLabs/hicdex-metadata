From Cannon digital SLR. Taken near The Hilltop Tavern, Banks Peninsula, New Zealand.  I take thousands of photos but this might be the only one worth minting.  I was on the road to town one evening and saw this moonrise in a purple/pink sky and had to pull over and take dozens of photographs (IT WAS REALLY COLD!!!).  Years later I still love looking at this image.

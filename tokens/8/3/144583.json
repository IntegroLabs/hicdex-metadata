That\u2019s where I get my energy from, apart from dreams. That\u2019s where I am myself. Fully. (so I keep walking.)  I thought about Thailand yesterday and how this place made me feel. I was there for a pretty long time if that makes sense. Remember the moment of landing in Bangkok, going to my hostel, sitting outside of it at 11 P.M watching the neons with Thai alphabet on it, feeling the warm humid air pleasantly surrounding my body and making my hippie clothes stick to it. I lit a cig, took a sip of a cold beer from 7/11 down the road and thought: \u201cfcuk me man, I\u2019m home\u201d.  So I thought about how badly I missed this magic world of journey sometimes. And I came across my old videos I recorded while hitchhiking there. With the wind in my hair, with the freedom in my soul.  I found myself there. I truly did. This was a place where I understood who I really was and what I wanted from life. It introduced me to someone very important - myself. And made me grow with it as a human with his vision of life. Vision that doesn\u2019t need to be understood, but respected. And I wish that to all of you, beautiful people. Love each other.  Videos, piece and words by @themindfcuk , weird as always, vibin\u2019 quite ordinarily.

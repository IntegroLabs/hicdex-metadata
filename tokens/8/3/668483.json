Was starting from the curiosity to take pictures at night when a lot of human activities have stopped, I did it from midnight to early morning. I forced myself to walk along the streets and corners of the city, tried to find subjects that in a form and time had a \u201csoul\u201d. I didn't know what I was really doing, I just stepped in and set my sights. Night time makes me avoid distractions and can concentrate more to see and feel. For me, and maybe also most people, a quiet atmosphere can be self-reflection and sometimes it's a good time to have a dialogue with ourself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQfmtLa94THiFG8jof5akJJXWsX37eyPvmvguh4nF48LM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQXFT5bTYtYkgK6Tn1EQifB7Scm41AmHsDGpGPAMtETmj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQfmtLa94THiFG8jof5akJJXWsX37eyPvmvguh4nF48LM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NyW7KvKq8BfezvenDuUCixs3rfgVm4jc3"], "tags": ["erirapu", "night", "scenery", "photography", "streetphotography", "photoseries", "photoproject", "animal", "bnw", "blackandwhite", "sculpture"], "extra": {}}

It was a simple piece with the silhouette of a man with a flower for his head. Sometimes when I'm down I feel as if my head is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. Other times , especially when I'm creating I feel as if my head is a flower, flourishing in the sunlight with no walls to stop me from growing however I need to grow.\n\n- @IYKTYFK", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRQmiKyE5U44WaewS6hRCNyDJqyHvqV1gjpvHd1X43rjC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYCYA5ToDZ9YDZtcpZEi9mdqpBHe1QB91eafJ6hfe6Dey", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRQmiKyE5U44WaewS6hRCNyDJqyHvqV1gjpvHd1X43rjC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1d4dbEdpCysGL6fVRTLg5sj5YNTd4mRZqe"], "tags": ["IYKTYFK", "ILLUSTRATION", "Photoshop"], "extra": {}}

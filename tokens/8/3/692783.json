{"__version": 1, "token_id": 692783, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Light", "description": "Malakoff Square. Inaugurated on March 24, 1859. First structure in Cuba made of cast iron and glazed, a plant in cross of equal arms and 8 staircases of 23 steps to accede to the stalls of the high ones. At the time it was considered the best and most colorful market in Cuba, after the reconstructed Mercado de Tac\u00f3n or Plaza del Vapor in the capital.\nThe distinction of this place is its circular center of 20 meters in diameter with the quincallas and the dome of iron and stained glass elevated to 15 meters. Topped with a light metal ball of a meter and a half in diameter. To the form of this dome is that it owes its name, first baptized by popular mouth and then official.\nMalakoff is the name of a suburb of Sevastopol and a battle fought there during the Crimean War on September 7, 1855. In his honor a small town in France is named after him. But the euphoria of this victory and as Frenchmen at last gave rise to fashion Malakoff. Women began to wear frames that from the waist to the floor widened the skirts and the 5 or 6 petticoats they wore. At first they were made of woven horsehair and were called crinoline, later replaced by thin steel sheets.\nPerhaps without intending to, the engineers made a Malakoff design and Malakoff stayed. \nCity of C\u00e1rdenas, Matanzas, Cuba", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPw5TdaoaXoaxRmNm3R4WJszXniGCDZihdArQit7LVTZ6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZk1mDQivZnPCmMKHFNFTer2hgnHmmnyVi4GmBj33Fcwc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPw5TdaoaXoaxRmNm3R4WJszXniGCDZihdArQit7LVTZ6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZmSrYiqNhamu3X7VPQGbB1QP7XqWHZ2cV"], "tags": ["MalakoffSquare", "C\u00e1rdenas", "Photography", "Arquitecture"], "extra": {}}

She is also fascinated by the way in which computer-generated magic operates. Riko was summoned by a crystalline alien named Pele to deliver a stolen oracle algorithm to an infamous hacker collective. The algorithm was used to create a system of mathematical formulas to calculate the number of possible combinations of magical powers of the universe. Riko was able to obtain the algorithm for the crystalline alien and she used it to create a computer simulation of a future world where the universe would be governed by a neural network trained on the oracle algorithms.","tags":["GAN","AI","scifi","fantasy"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmQgEwySDUngV78dNM1fvJyXse6jTxssGFztZELpMU2wui"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQgEwySDUngV78dNM1fvJyXse6jTxssGFztZELpMU2wui","display_uri":"ipfs://QmSUu5kAJpVyWLoReArw9EYyN4azxTCDGhRUd4q9mJuBkS","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

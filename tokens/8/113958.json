You can already feel the intracranial bird. It is she who breaks bones, it is her feathers, burning in the acid of the soul, bursting from her chest in a hoarse cloudy vapor of breath.

You look up to the sky, pet your own rabbits and mummify yourself alive. Only the sky remains with you, in you, around, only the sky, only the sky ... But still, the sky is perhaps the most graceful poison.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbyvxMqhyCtyWtuGw4FRVo5WM8g5h1oGkL4LEKLojwwKo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbyvxMqhyCtyWtuGw4FRVo5WM8g5h1oGkL4LEKLojwwKo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": [ "tz1ePSjwH41f5LZMtKKFHhY41QA7ixBLAhq3" ], "tags": [ "HELL", "EGG", "BIRDS", "SOUL", "SKY", "MOON", "NIMBUS", "BLACK", "RED", "CRYPTOHAMSTER" ], "formats": [ { "mimeType": "image/gif", "uri": "ipfs://QmbyvxMqhyCtyWtuGw4FRVo5WM8g5h1oGkL4LEKLojwwKo" } ], "token_info": { "@@empty": "ipfs://QmPjaTkPD7vTxxLnnoVshkLcbxWecEdnpYAmZBi7zowsEm" }, "supply": "500", "transfered": 0 }

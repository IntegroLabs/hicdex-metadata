The displayed waveform can then be analyzed for properties such as amplitude, frequency, rise time, time interval, distortion, and others.","tags":["oscilloscope","vcvrack"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://Qme2cSftv8ug4vQYe1bUrUHa89fhPYTZWbEY52FU8no5hG","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qme2cSftv8ug4vQYe1bUrUHa89fhPYTZWbEY52FU8no5hG","display_uri":"ipfs://Qme2cSftv8ug4vQYe1bUrUHa89fhPYTZWbEY52FU8no5hG","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

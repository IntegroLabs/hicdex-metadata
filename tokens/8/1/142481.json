So, recently watched an anime series, there, I saw a girl and at first sight, I fell in her love. She was the most beautiful thing that I had ever seen and I wanted her with me. But it was impossible. So I took the advantage of my art skills and drew myself with her. That's why, I named this artwork \"Fictophilia\". Here, We are in love with each other", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmStfHqTk2S24j4emfiHta5qoga9xhFKRVSuB11SF47PxS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTUSHyMxJJhtnXFdNXjmZL1fWoyciMLddFKVcjdGAZSzi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmStfHqTk2S24j4emfiHta5qoga9xhFKRVSuB11SF47PxS", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1W92GYuzaRkMnLS31qkYDCn299CGdHooyU"], "tags": ["#Fictophilia#Waifu#Fictionallove#zerotwo#couple#love"], "extra": {}}

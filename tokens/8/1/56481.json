Wolfram cellular automata framework. This is “rule 89” developed for about 400 generations starting from generation 550. The colorization algorithm I wrote uses a randomized “cold” palette as base and adds warmer hues here and there. The outcome is quite dynamic and hectic, almost mimicking an intense meteor shower. I particularly like the pixelated/retro graphics effect produced by the rigid grid structure that underpins the whole cellular automata system.","tags":["generative","cellularautomata","pixelart","abstract","sky","night"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmdsWLd1etp1Penaszs6gZ3Kr44Y5jGXWJaQmmax2FA1xP"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdsWLd1etp1Penaszs6gZ3Kr44Y5jGXWJaQmmax2FA1xP","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

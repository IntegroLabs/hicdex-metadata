Autobiographical abstraction. \n\nUNION pieces are what happens when BINARY and SPECTRUM pieces collide and break apart, providing a more playful canvas for the colour blocks to dance amidst the white squares and find oblique representations of the story they're expressing.\n\nIN DREAMS\n---------------------\nWhat if all our dreams are happening in the same place?\nA multi-lane highway of human filament connecting us all to a twilight motel.\nInside, we are not bodies, but colours - engaged in a vibrant dialogue on an unreachable axis that can't so easily convert into such limited concepts as pictures and words.\nSo, all we're left with is an echo; shadows of a fourth dimension, lost in translation, that speaks of connections that transcend time and space. \nMaybe that's why I still see you\nin dreams.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdkY24x6VhrjyJxhTvtkkz4KQCeWEHrKf8uvJCYrfn3MY", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmbq7Y8ASEAeaReCEyDk8vARUjpiDndTgX95saUtUtDqfM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdkY24x6VhrjyJxhTvtkkz4KQCeWEHrKf8uvJCYrfn3MY", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WqiSCF73e2YK85VL2EXrgL5oti3AkJEKf"], "tags": ["expressionist", "abstractart", "abstract", "fineart", "minimalism", "minimalistart", "literary", "abstractexpressionism"], "extra": {}}

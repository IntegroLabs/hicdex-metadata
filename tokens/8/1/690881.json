This is the 8th piece in the Monochrome Designs \u2014 Black and White. The last of the Collage Creatures todays design in my opinion may be the most abstract of the 5 designs. There is no clear body, limb or face but the great thing about these designs the more you look the more your mind will seek out familiar things to relate to including the relative human form. But who's to say that other types of life have to follow the same rules that dictate life here on earth. Just look at some of the most strange creatures that coexist with us, but also imagine they breathe Nitrogen or could only survive in temperatures over 1000 degrees. But because we're conscious of our own existence we will always gravitate towards things that we recognize and what we know.

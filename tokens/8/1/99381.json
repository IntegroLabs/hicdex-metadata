She is the patron deity of metalsmiths, miners, and jewelry-makers. She has a luminous aura that no man can resist and her touch can transform anything into gold. While she is capable of bestowing great wealth, she is also known for imposing extremely cruel punishments on the greedy - making Bulawan a deity that was both venerated and feared by the ancient Visayans.","tags":["bulawan","greed","goddess","gold","aswang","cryptid","monster","creature","mythology","myth","philippines","filipino","pinoy","black","dark","illustration","digital"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmdDoKu1be6k7ubfoJX1xfHmvCrgUpCoUpRwJ2ixWonFQh"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdDoKu1be6k7ubfoJX1xfHmvCrgUpCoUpRwJ2ixWonFQh","display_uri":"ipfs://QmQqESk4eeAFVG9WjEMsRRgnbambhUd8oYsHXAPPpWj7mx","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

To me, they represent the best of poetry, zen buddhism, color theory, and art. I never get tired of making them for the right works. In BACK TO THE FUSCHIA, I re-watched the epic sci-fi '80s film 'Back to the Future' and it got me thinking about the concepts of space and time and how they are linked together as the fabric of the universe, spacetime. I was trying to conceive of how I could express this concept through words of poetry and puns with a certain level of panache. How do I take a hilariously awful color pun like 'BACK TO THE FUCHIA\" and make it seem like it's travelling through time? I began to experiment with varying the size of the fonts at certain points as well as overlapping the words to create a inward spiral, which intimates a sense of movement towards the center. The last piece of the puzzle was switching to lighter tints of color on the smaller fonts. It was an interesting experiment, so much so that you'll see on the next couple of pages that I couldn't help myself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRgfkMsm24va1xbFs4sHKdXMVFPfZo5PUyLg7XyDKqDY4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZoUipQKXSUkMRA3jGnApbYBkcrZxbNC5U3LWwQggEK1E", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRgfkMsm24va1xbFs4sHKdXMVFPfZo5PUyLg7XyDKqDY4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

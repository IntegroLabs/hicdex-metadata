To gain for himself a seat in Heaven, man devastated the Earth. Yet she renewed herself, the good mother, and came again each Spring, radiant with youthful beauty, beckoning her children to come to her bosom and partake of her bounty.\"\n[MOTHER EARTH, Vol.1 March, 1906]\n\nThis artwork consists of what I called Terra (Earth) and Crotalaria, a genus of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae or Leguminosae, that has been used in natural farming as \"green manure\" to fertilize the soil. The root of crotalaria and other Leguminosae often be a home for Rhizobium bacterias that fixated the Nitrogen from the air to the soil so they can grow even in soil low in Nitrogen, and when they grow they also share the Nitrogen to plants near them.\n\n- Digital Drawing\n- 4000x6000\n- 300 DPI", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRKJ2VW6rYSBQrnmbp7C2cBrHERACUANGJpeVGjfZxy73", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcsfLC7XbkeGEfSueBsfamoJqy54Tyy6b9V12qK44vkfg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRKJ2VW6rYSBQrnmbp7C2cBrHERACUANGJpeVGjfZxy73", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1M78K8EDmRgfFDowTqzuWiXCL84ieDJptB"], "tags": ["woman", "earth", "gaia", "naked", "plant", "pencil"], "extra": {}}

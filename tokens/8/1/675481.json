{"__version": 1, "token_id": 675481, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Atritone", "description": "In Greek mythology, Athena is the daughter most loved by Zeus. She is described as a goddess who is beautiful and graceful but has a nature that emanates power and authority. \n\nAthena also has several weapon attributes such as a Corinthian helmet with an elaborate crest and holding a long spear in one hand and an Aegis in the other. At the center of her aegis, there\u2019s oftentimes an image of a Gorgon\u2019s head, symbolizing the gift she got from Perseus: the head of Medusa. \n\nAs a symbol of her wisdom, there\u2019s sometimes an owl flying in Athena\u2019s vicinity or sitting on her shoulder; from time to time there may also be a snake or an olive branch. As a war goddess associated with wisdom, Athena was often the main helper of Ancient Greece\u2019s greatest heroes. Most famously, she guided Odysseus during his ten-year-long journey back to Ithaca. Athena was also a master artisan. As much as she was the women counterpart of Ares as a war goddess, she was also the female equivalent of Hephaestus when it came to arts and crafts.

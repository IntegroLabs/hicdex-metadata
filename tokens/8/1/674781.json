You do not need to be photographed it by the person who drinks it to show. It can be displayed in an old apothecary, which gives it a certain originality and nostalgia, and at the same time has the same sense of calm. For this purpose, I created an apothecary simulation inside my photography studio and took a photo of it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZCk15suymC1t46LuR3mjsoQHfGwDXB3V3t8AtgTE7u11", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUiJA2X817GQoKFXoPQ8TZ8iY3GBaiGLZZFxMg6V2p6nK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZCk15suymC1t46LuR3mjsoQHfGwDXB3V3t8AtgTE7u11", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1frnJHNqMchEJjBFBrJ39vaj7rrRRq5ycH"], "tags": ["rosewater", "nostalgia", "photography", "apothecary", "photoshop", "longexposer"], "extra": {}}

An exploration of the depiction of different tones of skin, the creation of an image as an artifice and the nature of colour. To copy is to dialogue, to interview, to question. As a whole, this and other pieces in the same format are an exploration in the qualities of the image in the contemporary world, as animated statements, from gifs used in our daily mobile conversations to the big screens repeating an endless advertising in the luminous billboards of the street, an image of kinetic nature, movement and light, colour and light. filetype: mp4/mkv  author: gefercan year of creation: 2021 lenght: 40 seconds (aprox) size: 1280 x 1280 (aprox).

This is the 19th letter in The Cool Alphabet, W Is For Wolverine. I loved comics as a kid but couldn't really afford to buy them. The few that I did have were almost all X-Men comics and by far my favorite character was Wolverine. Even more influential for me was the Saturday morning X-Men animated show which used to air on Fox Kids with an entire morning of shows like Where In The World Is Carmen SanDiego, Dog City, Eek! The Cat, the animated Batman series, Power Rangers and Red Planet. I absolutely loved these shows and the top of the bill were The X-Men. Everyone knows Wolverine by now with the incredible success of the films but I have wanted to be him since I was like 11 years old. He had retractable claws made of an indestructible metal, he whooped major butt and he was a smart-ass \u2014 which I loved. He was sort of an anti-hero for a bit but grew into his role as a major part of the X-Men which is still my favorite Marvel franchise despite the success of The Avengers and all the heroes encompassed in that universe. I think Hugh Jackman has been an amazing Wolverine over the years but I am looking forward to new content featuring this wild animal of a mutant.

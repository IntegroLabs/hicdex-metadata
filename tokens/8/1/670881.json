Show love through chat and video calls.\nSometimes I miss hugs, kisses, and spending time with my girlfriend.\n\nIt's not easy to live apart Sometimes we fight just because my girlfriend is sick. And I'm angry that I can't take care of her. or feeling discouraged because she doesn't know what he is doing But in the end we managed to get through it.\n\nValentine's Day is that I dress prettier every day. Choose the most beautiful dress in the wardrobe. new lipstick color\nPrepare her favorite blue balloons. And today will be the day we forgive each other. to count one new And start to support our love again\n\nOf course, the first thing we do when we meet is the normal kiss that I miss the most.\n\nbefore having to go back to working hard again before we are apart I recharge myself by spending the day with my partner. do everything that lovers do Of course I won't tell you what I did.

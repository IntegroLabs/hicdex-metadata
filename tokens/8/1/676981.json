So ALPHABET would become ABPHABET and then ABCHABET, and so on. What are left with or what we have created I should say is part of the alphabet made from the word ALPHABET. Can you tell that I've been focused on autological words, phrases, and all aspects of the visual? It just astounds me that any of this is even possible. Crazy as it seems, it does indeed exist...and so much more is out there to be discovered and uncovered.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZYykBZXM48n9YdVppC5624QAiepKYc5BS1xYyZNRgjXc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbdiHiD2M1WHR2Y9k4zCoDkkQ4MRiPLMNiFBRA2jAPgop", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZYykBZXM48n9YdVppC5624QAiepKYc5BS1xYyZNRgjXc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

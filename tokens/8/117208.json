This was done by Banksy, which I didn't learn until a couple years later. I paid a Palestinian cab driver to take me to their side of the wall and took a few photos of the \"graffiti\"/art with my iPhone. The West Bank is walled off like a prison and heavily guarded by the Israelis. For those reasons, of all the \"graffiti\" I saw, this one resonated the most with me. I hope this pic introduces others to this amazing piece of art or gives some context to those who have seen it before. // 1 of 1 Remix created by @FutureNow_Art, part owners of #BAYC 9460", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWPbyJSX95EpJ3qbS2rr5sYv5bMk2zKLQKtyXVrLMFWnN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVNEaozRFzJ13aW8goS9B25Zji2G5GSyCzk6T2uf2mL9c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz2NJibqmx1XmutgHhxCZk87F7LVmdERsGdJ"], "tags": [""], "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmWPbyJSX95EpJ3qbS2rr5sYv5bMk2zKLQKtyXVrLMFWnN"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmRD9119zTMnYQTD1uPYWPQwEEAAPJqV357FFtAbxzj91J"}, "supply": "20"}

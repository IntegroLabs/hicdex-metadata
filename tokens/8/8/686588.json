And I will say this is the best wolf I\u2019ve created to date. If you\u2019ve been following me lately. You\u2019d know I\u2019m experimenting. And I am very pleased with my results. Now I use to paint watercolor sceneries all the time. So it\u2019s wild to do it again and now utilize it with my current work. Like the background wasn\u2019t even sketched. I just painted it on the fly after the wolf.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/CajnwEdFij3", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWopttJXoRNKW1BStXyQEp5q42aJKdHyhKB84mFkhkc1h", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVdAsGsxhgMYyj7pMh5xgkdYBKUvSKhceRZXxBVyMAP4u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWopttJXoRNKW1BStXyQEp5q42aJKdHyhKB84mFkhkc1h", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gWYm9BDyyKUfz7vgFzpWJ3L4hED3v3sEN"], "tags": ["art", "comic", "sketch", "drawing", "digital", "color", "genesis", "wolf", "evil"], "extra": {}}

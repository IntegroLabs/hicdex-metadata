Pinkish palm trees waved at us in the wind as we entered. It had been a long time since I had seen them. Korgan the Childish, Buck and Leon. I recently had the luck of acquiring a framed map from my dead grandson's inheritance. He had bought it at a flea market from a crippled accountant. Angry over the poor inheritance he had left me I tossed the silly picture in the wall, breaking the frame, and exposing the fancifull backside of the papyrus. Tucked in there was a horribly worn little pamflett. \n\n\u201cFriends. Companions. This is it.\u201d I threw the book on the tabletop with a slap.

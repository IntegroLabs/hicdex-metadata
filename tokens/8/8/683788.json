Good...here's another one for you and oh would you look at that, we've ironically gone BACK TO THE FUCHSIA, but this time it's BLACK TO THE FUCHSIA! Not only is this self-referential, but now it's a double color pun! The bad jokes just don't stop folks. Can't stop, won't stop. In BLACK TO THE FUCHSIA, we return to the original form of the mantra mandalas and discover the richness of now black and fuchsia clash and yet harmoniously coexist in this current state. There is something about repeating words over and over and over again that creates a certain comfort as if you're willing something into being and you're not alone; surrounded by your thoughts and creations. There is nothing more powerful and intoxicating than the human mind. We create our own realities. Everything we experience is because of the chemicals in our minds. BLACK TO THE FUCHSIA's color scheme messes with my cones and rods, as the human eye cannot truly perceive magenta/fuchsia; it's the only fully-saturated color that's not present in the rainbow. Crazy to think that we're seeing something that actually doesn't exist, we're just perceiving it a certain way. Boggles my mind sometimes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaKBQLZXgb7CaSJjq5ngB13F31X7M41xqGAgkmG9Vta4C", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNT1Hz6Mc5RqJHeXz6MutghaKL6DZfaPwEj2mxKdfwQXE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaKBQLZXgb7CaSJjq5ngB13F31X7M41xqGAgkmG9Vta4C", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 674788, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Be Human", "description": "Humans are thinking animals, the biological function of humans is the same as animals.  But humans are equipped with reason and conscience, it makes humans different from animals.  This work tells about humans having to use their minds in living their lives, and if humans don't use their minds, all that is left of humans is only an animal.\n  In this work, I use the visual metaphor of a deformed object from a human, which is seen using both hands and feet like an animal.  Then there is the object of a mouse that is above the human body, it does not describe humans not using their minds, there is nothing left of the human only even more.  The use of the mouse object means that the rat is known as a greedy animal but the rat only eats what he commands it, unlike humans, human greed will not devour everything he wants, regardless of anything.  NB: (whoever collects this work, I will give each one a bonus from my other artwork, which I save randomly)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme593ohEUu4mALhhrwg578gMBXaWdsyTQGSYKBzx5LMjH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPWfnkXrCq7qaLuucLELXJwDKd832dzySPaa91kGiwP13", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme593ohEUu4mALhhrwg578gMBXaWdsyTQGSYKBzx5LMjH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LRmTHhPB68ZXynoChC6HVvLF2ZDTG6LyP"], "tags": ["Nft", "nftcollectibels", "nftcollector", "nftcollection", "artforsale", "painting", "photoart", "cryptoart", "fineart", "rawat", "ekspresionisme", ""], "extra": {}}

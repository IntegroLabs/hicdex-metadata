It transmutes from a decentralizing network contagion crossing the barrier between technical machines and organic flesh, spreading rapidly from species to species.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcUpqLRGxbUywpcX8Rrmj6Ekv46fFJKE5ePTQsx9kSdQz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXGT8XGDRmx5jkCpj2HJamGLGTJgJ6vimaphxBtHESXkk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcUpqLRGxbUywpcX8Rrmj6Ekv46fFJKE5ePTQsx9kSdQz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1M7L5RAmsoJmuWCpvXw8PYwLE4apwriDvJ"], "tags": ["Cryptoborg", "metaverse", "cyberpunk", "cipherpunk", "encryption", "cryptography", "falsememory"], "extra": {}}

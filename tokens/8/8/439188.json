All four tracks from the previous four CMYK NFTs are mixed together. Right here!  I hope you enjoy it! \n\nIn the CMYK printing process, individually these four colors work fine on their own but together they can make any full color photo. The music for the 4NFTs here are meant to be played all together but work fine individually. Be your own DJ- The composition will be different every time! This NFT combines all four tracks together. Composers edition.\n\n*Sound design by @fendelmarc & @sistersageherbs - Recorded & Mixed in Seattle, WA \n\n*Art by @mightymoss\n\nCollectors of this NFT may use the music for your own project.

For example, the concept of a \u201cmetaverse.\u201d The idea of a metaverse is challenging to conceive without the advent of computers, the internet, and the creativity of digital ecosystems. But with these creations we get to experience things we couldn\u2019t have imagined previously. *//>>> The idea for this piece first came when I saw screenshots of a VR NFT gallery. The thought arose, \u201cWell, if NFTs can be viewed in AR/VR, then we open up the possibility to view the BACK of a 2D image.\u201d And if that\u2019s the case, is there a experience we can have \u2014 whether conceptual, psychological, visual, etc \u2014 that opens up a new perception we previously haven\u2019t been able to access? *//>>> I don\u2019t know the answer, I\u2019ve yet to see a piece that addresses this, hence why we\u2019re giving it a shot here with an intention for final display in AR/VR. Let\u2019s start with simple questions, simple explorations. I\u2019m curious if there is a shift in perception between concepts of dimensionality \u2014 INSIDE-OUTSIDE, or perhaps even FRONT-BACK \u2014 as it applies to our daily physical 3D reality. \u201cWhat is INNER, what is OUTER?\u201d Yanno, questions like that.

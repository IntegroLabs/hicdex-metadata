In their deep state of meditation, they did not notice a thief who had sneaked up on them.

Infuriated by the act, the Citipati swore vengeance to the thief and became the archenemy of thieves and other criminals.","tags":["LuisToledo","Laprisamata","art","animation","digitalart","tibet","death","skeleton","skulls","animation2d","GIF","meditation","myth","psychedelicart","psyart","visionaryart","surrealart","surrealism","LSD","visionaryart"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmQLzRcwYPVPwfmUxYEd4CoEA1MSf3pmymCaLnVTEMUeb1"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQLzRcwYPVPwfmUxYEd4CoEA1MSf3pmymCaLnVTEMUeb1","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

When I graduated high school the first Ipod hadn't even been released yet. I was headed to art school and of course I needed a computer and using my graduation money I was able to buy myself a brand new, Sage green Imac. At that point they had been out for a bit considering Sage was in the 2nd wave of those original Imacs. 4 computers later and I still love the sound it makes when you first hit that power button. I couldn't even tell you how man versions of the OS have come and gone since the year 2000, but I can tell you I miss this smiley face icon that use to greet me as the machine started up. As cliche as it might be, we could always use more happiness in the world.

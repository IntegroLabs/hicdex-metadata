It's also wandering through some preenFM2 synth settings. #1 in the modularmountain series, artwork for bandcamp album found here https://kaotec.bandcamp.com/  The music was inspired on the picture, composed while I was there. The visuals were inspired on the music, overdubbed on the picture. They are dynamic clojure(quil) patches, live coded in conjunction with live patched modular music.","tags":["modularmountains","kaotec"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmSHsTMAd9AE7a6iUXceN4fP9Z9v5rQvr1TdZicYnFMbAk"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSHsTMAd9AE7a6iUXceN4fP9Z9v5rQvr1TdZicYnFMbAk","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNMusTvvAub1HgoVbhKgHeFyZcrzJC3KGHs6dC6Wif3GZ","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

In the purest essence of myself I feel that humans failed humanity. Sometimes things and people will hurt us. However, we also grow and progress through accepting the lessons of pain, so in a way, those who hurt are hurting. I don’t think we need a label of any kind to be the chosen one. Therefore I created this piece to remind everyone, that you are ELECTI (Chosen “in Latin), whether you were chosen by others or not, The Universe has chosen you to be here and a part of it. It is all how you perceive and look at things. You are the Chosen One.","tags":["electi","chosen","one","animkhitaryan"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmPPXFt5SooRBtFJazKu6BfzrMJr1pD52WaUNBGYgvCYAf","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPPXFt5SooRBtFJazKu6BfzrMJr1pD52WaUNBGYgvCYAf","display_uri":"ipfs://Qme3EdK6B72iwxJbWb2GYhryNsqfdeUbrVZFbAd3yUbrdT","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

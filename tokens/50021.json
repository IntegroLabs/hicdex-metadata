Dried in under the sun to create a coral reef texture.  The palette was inspired by the ocean colors I observed while vacationing as a child. The ocean was a special place to me. Adding movement to this piece was the perfect way to bring my memories back to life. I hope the settled oceanic movement and palette transports the viewer to the peaceful state of mind this piece takes me to.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaNVoK1PSD98HEAUcjVcJGrp1SbDt4dkvgXbpjappyFAV","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1ZrZY5vhBcgE1R7shHN4PW884Y7cbFasKm"],"tags":["ocean","2D","animation","acrylic","abstract"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmaNVoK1PSD98HEAUcjVcJGrp1SbDt4dkvgXbpjappyFAV"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmcM97Wt4AsJ3u6cdYMYj3yRQ9jsFbwi2ZewHiSgNU7rVN"},"supply":"11","transfered":16}

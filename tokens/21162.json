I made this one some years ago in response to the gentrification and marginalisation of the creative communities in my hometown. You’ve probably heard a similar story elsewhere. The only other thing that bothered me was the fact that my red and green inks were not bright enough, well, maybe that and a notorious incident which took place in a cafe one evening. Anyway now I’ve edited it so y’all can finally enjoy it with proper coloured monopoly buildings. Peace.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXfw4E2eFviPnZz86i9CU25XhWQCmHoym2MA58egSMGue","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmXfw4E2eFviPnZz86i9CU25XhWQCmHoym2MA58egSMGue"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmV1pamrnNxrLGj32LC2fox1bCxN7nW4hTPCUTFEaVraHR"},"supply":"300","transfered":262}

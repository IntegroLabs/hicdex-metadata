This year, May 25 is the 20th anniversary of the Towel Day. It is the day to commemorate the author Douglas Adams, writer of the awesome work the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. If you like to join the celebration, please carry a towel with you. The Towel Day, a wonderful tribute to Adams and a sign in public to identify as hitchhiker :)  Of course, a good towel belongs to the standard equipment of my luggage. In addition to the practical value of warmth and shade, it always offers in large letters a wise advice for life: DON'T PANIC. On the occasion of Towel Day 2021 I took as usual a photo, somewhere on planet Earth. This time, the pandemic version, I stay at home, in Berlin, Germany with my suitcase ready to travel again.   I like to share this photo \u2018Towel Day 2021\u2019 with the fans and hitchhiker\u2019s of the H=N community. 42 collectable NFT are available.  41 for just 0.5 tezos.  1 for the price of 42 tezos. This is the collector version and it includes one DON\u2019T PANIC towel. Shipping worldwide.

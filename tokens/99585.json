This specific weekend Toronto was hosting a mix of celebrities, athletes, and musicians for some of the biggest events. During a private afterparty I was approached by Lebron's Manager and told \"He doesn't normal let people take pictures of him, but he has asked if you could shoot a few for him\". The view down the lenses of my camera is one that I will never forget, it was almost as if I was face to face with a cardboard cut out, instead it was the legend himself. - Gabriel Di Sante", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX8trE5aHh4PZks3J62yHU9Gqb18zkXzDR4vjQ7QoYMuB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTstVH6TLf2f3iaxvTGeYxLANDnv5SQ3VwDMm82jkFVmE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": ["tz1cvkGoM12RFWyutnrW9k45GFBsFwBkKZR9"], "tags": ["nba", "lebron", "kingjames", "gabrieldisante", "toronto", "torontophotographer"], "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmX8trE5aHh4PZks3J62yHU9Gqb18zkXzDR4vjQ7QoYMuB"}], "token_info": {"@@empty": "ipfs://QmZxVJ3Ef55bJfZdRhTevTmJ4NLLfgZWgXcuPfbswrq9xu"}, "supply": "1", "transfered": 0}

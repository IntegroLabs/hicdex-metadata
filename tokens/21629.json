Swarms are everywhere. From the lowest level of cells in the body, to beehives and right up to societies. Swarms are the aggregation of lots of little actions by \"dumb\" agents. Each action on its own is inconsequential but they all add up to create complex behaviours at the level of the organism. One day we will create buildings using collections of agents.

Unable to dedicate effort into oil painting, I'd make these digital paintings on tablet in a na√Øve, simplified aesthetic. Not having the pressure to paint accurately gave me the will to paint again and got me out of depression. This first painting presents this pink skinned character I saw as an alter ego, writing ephemeral thoughts that disappear in a sinking ocean. He is hooded to keep his identity secret from those who might recognize him as the artist he once was. He write's \"you were never here\" but the final e of \"here\" is stretched and unreadable making it \"you were never her\".

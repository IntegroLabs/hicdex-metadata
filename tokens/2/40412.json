In Buddhism, there is a practice of breathing where one focuses on the gap between breaths instead of the breaths themselves. It is this gap – this space between, this space before impulse or breath – that fascinates me. In this digital painting, I wanted to zoom into the synapse and imagine the electric, invisible chemistry that happens there; a moment of infinite potential.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmfCuxeDYYmv3vx9MUKutPs11Stju1SMPSAV8ASNbNyu7y","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1PbvkAuKS9fNKWq5sytLzLr77S9tsJWH6H"],"tags":["digitalart","digitalpainting","neurology","buddhism","breath","synapse","science","chemistry","electricity"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmfCuxeDYYmv3vx9MUKutPs11Stju1SMPSAV8ASNbNyu7y"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmVveP5tKQ7Qw11UvWon7kPmrNAB1NV7GHhnf6btv2T8F8"},"supply":"10","transfered":10}

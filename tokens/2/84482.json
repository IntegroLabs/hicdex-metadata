If we would only look up and look around we could see the possibilities.  We would realize the cage is made up of our own limiting beliefs and negative self talk our own shoulds, and what-ifs.  The cage isn’t real. . It some ways it is safe to live in a self-imposed cage. The cage gives us a place to put the blame and keeps us safe. It prevents us from really having to take a risk or to face our fears and our inner critic. Unfortunately, the pain comes in when we realize we have lived a life stuck on a path that we didn’t really want, that we didn’t really choose. All we have to do is lift our heads up, look around and say to ourselves–do I like my path, is this where I want to be?  And if not–what is one change I can make?","artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmd4eoUAgRPXtxYwSr85BaQVQGDErMvtAPeDiDhQK15abz","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1bacDctbNfBUE3q1WTE1KgAw5KPbtJF8Cb"],"tags":["#dark","#moody","#self","#photography","#photo","#darkart","#reflective","#trapped"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmd4eoUAgRPXtxYwSr85BaQVQGDErMvtAPeDiDhQK15abz"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmT3fh1o7mSLho89cEnKfRvTVk1wLofSJCArPvJFF2YhMZ"},"supply":"25","transfered":29}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 169323, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Snapshots of the Planar", "description": "\"Snapshots of the Planar\" is an eternal, generative audio piece. It is completely synthesized in the viewer's browser, in realtime.\n\nUsing carefully calibrated \"Planar Technology\", the synthesizer continuously modifies its timbre and behavior to provide 6-stages of primitive tranquility. The \"Planar\" rarely repeats, and instead eternally unfolds.\n\nThis piece marks the first in a series of exploratory OBJKTs built with Zequencer, a new tool for web-based music creation.\n\nTo listen: Press anywhere on the OBJKT. If on mobile, make sure to turn off \"silent-mode\".\n\nTo play with the underlying projkt, go here:\nhttps://zequencer.io/create/QmTaMvjM2XRxzpbtX8XPUzDsqq8x9mK2gkmGa8gUDNM6XB\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXKKAsBNtw7C7gtSoLBetB55P6vgSGfKX2LdPXBG4vgfY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRtxCnZXV5JJ6csivC3d7dQVhAoJri381xDuPYRhhJHXQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmSiGZPQLNb1m58L51GQbGfkUuQmhAsBJqfYciS57gBV5B", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXKKAsBNtw7C7gtSoLBetB55P6vgSGfKX2LdPXBG4vgfY", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1goviA98Gy5sMzo8T8ZJZqBvXFi81Pqtpi"], "tags": ["generative", "web-audio", "audio", "ambient"], "extra": {}}

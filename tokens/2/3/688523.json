The answer is emphatic and pretentious yes! In WE'RE WOLVES WITHIN WEREWOLVES WITHIN, we've created the narrative that there are primal instincts of a wolf within the werewolves which are the deep rooted darkness that are within all of us; a triple entendre! (Whoa there Andrew, are you labelling all of us monsters? Who do you think you are?) No, you're probably not a monster and no I'm not intimating that at any point you or anyone you know is a monster. The reality is though, in all of us lies the potential of good and bad. I have always used the term limbs of construction / limbs of destruction to describe human behavior. Most of us never engage the darker aspects of our human nature, but rest assured...it's there. We all have the power to move our body and mind. Do we choose to engage others and the world with positivity or negativity? Can we harness the power of the wolf, the power of the werewolf within all of us towards something better? If so, what does that look like?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSfWih11uyKhyD4YP44wfXCLtqWGjpc6Q3VNkBBbqovhH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcFhUVYScN1HCXicsvawx5UfA7ySNDTMVYCoN9MDoHhqB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSfWih11uyKhyD4YP44wfXCLtqWGjpc6Q3VNkBBbqovhH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

{"name": "\u2022  We are not free to stop being free  \u2022", "description": "The existentialist thinks that it is very uncomfortable that God does not exist, because with him all possibility of finding values in an intelligible heaven disappears; one can no longer have the good a priori, because there is no more infinite and perfect consciousness to think about it; it is not written anywhere that the good exists, that one must be honest, that one must not lie, since we are precisely on a plane where there are only men.   This is the starting point of existentialism: everything is permitted if God does not exist. And, consequently, man is abandoned, because he finds neither in himself nor outside of himself a possibility of holding on. Above all, he finds no excuses. There is no determinism, man is free, man is freedom.    If God does not exist, we do not find before us values or orders that legitimize our conduct. Thus we have no justifications or excuses. We are alone, without excuses. Man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he has not created himself, and yet, on the other hand, free, because once thrown into the world he is responsible for everything he does.", "tags": ["0xLxxl", "Absurdism", "Thoughts"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmdsFfPFXEtEHg2nDVVZBLHLyQhoyk97vrVuGi5H2pAU8a", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmTjC1xwKQshXzAQbgi4ZFcPZeTCYwKr6aJXE2SZ8dSnF7", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1SGoKJAdNunz1pBZe1a1Et8icfHjXoSa9j"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdsFfPFXEtEHg2nDVVZBLHLyQhoyk97vrVuGi5H2pAU8a", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

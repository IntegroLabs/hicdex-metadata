This is the starting point of existentialism: everything is permitted if God does not exist. And, consequently, man is abandoned, because he finds neither in himself nor outside of himself a possibility of holding on. Above all, he finds no excuses. There is no determinism, man is free, man is freedom.    If God does not exist, we do not find before us values or orders that legitimize our conduct. Thus we have no justifications or excuses. We are alone, without excuses. Man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he has not created himself, and yet, on the other hand, free, because once thrown into the world he is responsible for everything he does.","tags":["0xLxxl","Absurdism","Thoughts"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmdsFfPFXEtEHg2nDVVZBLHLyQhoyk97vrVuGi5H2pAU8a","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmdsFfPFXEtEHg2nDVVZBLHLyQhoyk97vrVuGi5H2pAU8a","display_uri":"ipfs://QmTjC1xwKQshXzAQbgi4ZFcPZeTCYwKr6aJXE2SZ8dSnF7","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

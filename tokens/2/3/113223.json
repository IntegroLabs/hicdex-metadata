The music produced in the country is now destined for a global playground, therefore the magnitude of our undertaking is evident. Our mission is to be the best possible conduit for the universal music being produced, to ensure that the musical talents can express themselves as best as they can, and to do justice to the audio products we publish. Two or three decades later, these times will certainly be remembered with the acts that we have included in our publishing schedule. This is no doubt a vital responsibility, but it is bound to reflect on our viewpoint, on our handling of the matter, and our implementation.

The main image in today's design is that of a rugged looking example of a man smoking a cigarette. Magazines stopped running tobacco ads in the early 2000s, but if they could still advertise, what would that even look like in today's world? Would the average man in the target demographic even be able to relate to the masculinity of cowboys and sports cars? I certainly never did. But if I had seen The Bones Brigade chain smoking all over the place, now that's a different story. Just goes to show that people of influence who have a popular public persona need to be better role models for the young people that look up to them. You never know what tiny action or thing you might do that could make a lasting impression on someone that admires you.

The memories evoked in the form of digital objects have no fixed shape: they take on various scenarios and lead to various structures. As an artist, one of my goals is to better understand the relationship between image and imagination and how they shape our world. The image can be a direct representation of a memory, a dream, or a nightmare, or it can lead to a reinterpretation of a specific memory. When confronted with the swirls of shape and texture in this pieces, I am struck by awe and fascination. I hope these images have the same effect on you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTrbnZc3L8PD8xU7yTp51EnaE6p44ETLHwZMJ5iEFtSZ8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW5cQGCETLTV2PPA8otJA81mKieeACrCsob98RG8Xpr44", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmcYHgAhKkCryAUinEii2yFHvV7L2Ddi2YsHi6XCh5xBDR", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTrbnZc3L8PD8xU7yTp51EnaE6p44ETLHwZMJ5iEFtSZ8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hAU9PCAk9kEawxBufqjzQt41z1n6uEEoa"], "tags": ["generativeart", "procedural", "abstract", "digital", "art", "generative"], "extra": {}}

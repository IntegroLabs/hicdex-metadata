This time it is a bit more centered on our perceptions of reality and how by the sheer virtue of our own consciousness, we are able to create reality around ourselves. Like Rene Descartes famously said, \"I think, therefore I am\", we create the world by our own perception. As we constantly scan the world around us with endless synaptic syncopation, we're left to believe that all there is, is what we see / hear / feel / taste / smell, which we now know from every contemporary and conceivable science is not true. With all that said, we do invoke the world with every breath we take, with every move we make.

Been taking in a lot of the informative content that he has left for us since his recent passing. This is something that stood out to me while listening to his audiobook & inspired this creation. Thank you Bob Proctor for the inspiration & teachings all of these years. Came across his work years ago after his appearance in \"The Secret\", which I love to believe helped me manifest a lot of positive results in the past. In recent years I forgot about all of this & could see how that alone has steered my mind elsewhere. I should definitely implement the law of attraction again..\n\n4000x5000.GIF\nDigital Abstraction\nby Daniel Jerome ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSLkp13yK7GoA2tbDppPnhVhLkyZC7DuFTNx9sFFerq8y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSLkp13yK7GoA2tbDppPnhVhLkyZC7DuFTNx9sFFerq8y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSLkp13yK7GoA2tbDppPnhVhLkyZC7DuFTNx9sFFerq8y", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1MVGesL1NyxCCdd3Fn5W8dPvgEL5n2bwwc"], "tags": ["digital", "art", "abstract", "gif", "loop", "nft", "nftart", "artwork", "digitalabstract", "abstraction", "abstractart"], "extra": {}}

{"name": "Mother and child II ", "description": "Wo owns this - know why! <3 There are two different species of gorilla, the Western (Gorilla gorilla) and the Eastern (Gorilla beringei). Both are considered \"Endangered\".  The species, which is more likely to be found in West Africa, is in turn divided into two subspecies. Here live the western lowland gorilla and the Cross River gorilla.  In eastern Africa, Gorilla beringei is divided into the two subspecies Eastern lowland gorilla (also called gray gorilla) and the mountain gorilla. Within the mountain gorillas, some scientists also distinguish between the populations of the Virunga Volcanoes and the Bwindi Forest.", "tags": ["gorillas", "apes", "savetheearth", "spreadtheword", "motherearth", "blackandwhitephotography"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmSw6ErDAgxzs28WS94RWfZicJUpkLRqr9G15d5NsXB2UC", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmZE7ia9ZEkE2jC3NFKJAxE76GUW2gXPXgAqe8EnSrEwCU", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1ahHn8hpmV5b9KjvHDNMjMijXV7URzT45x"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSw6ErDAgxzs28WS94RWfZicJUpkLRqr9G15d5NsXB2UC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

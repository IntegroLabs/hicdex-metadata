{"__version": 1, "token_id": 172423, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Sisyphus", "description": "\"As a punishment for his trickery, Hades made Sisyphus roll a huge boulder endlessly up a steep hill. The maddening nature of the punishment was reserved for Sisyphus due to his hubristic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself. Hades accordingly displayed his own cleverness by enchanting the boulder into rolling away from Sisyphus before he reached the top, which ended up consigning Sisyphus to an eternity of useless efforts and unending frustration. Thus it came to pass that pointless or interminable activities are sometimes described as Sisyphean.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXPuMa53HxkP4JG6UDpby4e5XvGnWmYXiDGH84PTD286R", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXPuMa53HxkP4JG6UDpby4e5XvGnWmYXiDGH84PTD286R", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXPuMa53HxkP4JG6UDpby4e5XvGnWmYXiDGH84PTD286R", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YuyeYd9VhZ5QWR1Q9X8ikiRcmMCvmKJWw"], "tags": ["Sisyphus", "greek", "mythology", "abstract", "gif", "animation"], "extra": {}}

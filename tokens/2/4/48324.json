Los Monchitos live in caves away from the attacks of other forest creatures. They are afraid of predators but sometimes the dangers do not come from other creatures.  They live in herds. They are friendly, elusive and fun to be with. They like to get into mischief without being seen. Only a lucky few know of their existence. However, they have a very serious problem of aggressiveness if they get too angry. @zigor #AmigosDimension","tags":["Monchito","Amigos","Ratapollo","zigor"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmSG3fqcADVFdpVrsb9VK9uf6srAp8N6sb5RZWqFeJ1EMT"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmSG3fqcADVFdpVrsb9VK9uf6srAp8N6sb5RZWqFeJ1EMT","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbHWLHtVqTBJtXjWtDMtgz6wBZ7RkTwZebm1Yh48zKpHa","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

I was listening to \"The Power of Love\" by recording artist: Huey Lewis and The News and was reading famous quotes from various artists, musicians, philosophers, etc. and a quote from Jimi Hendrix came up at the very moment the chorus to \"The Power of Love\" began. I shook my head in disbelief. No way could that kind of coincidence happen. Listening to \"The Power of Love\" and reading this quote: (When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace.) What could this coincidence possibly mean, if anything? 1) Could it mean that my artistic endeavors are validated and that I'm on the right track? 2) Maybe I have a much more intimate connection to music than I originally thought? 3) Or maybe it's just a coincidence and I should calm down and just go about my day. I certainly hope it's not option 3. There really is an inherent power of love over most of us. We all have the inalienable right to love and to be loved. As humans we also covet power in all its guises. Some of us want to be the 'alpha', some the 'beta', and some just want to survive to the next day. Humans' love of power is nothing new and will always be a counter-weight to the power of love.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbRs86JKKnTwU3FQ7A4jrCvutSqkADfphTqodxPKbK2bU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbEu5Q2K3AMKEJHEtbWGedwniUmnqXZmvv4YyxAXREFEZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbRs86JKKnTwU3FQ7A4jrCvutSqkADfphTqodxPKbK2bU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

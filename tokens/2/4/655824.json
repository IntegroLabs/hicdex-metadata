You get to choose the direction of your focus. I choose to focus on the good, even in the midst of the challenges. Where is your focus?\n\nToday the sun is shining warm on my skin and the sky is blue. Something I love is seeing the beautiful structure of the trees against the backdrop of the sky and watching the the fluffy clouds as they float by.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ2inBFzvQLmNNR6CcWp4CnRskQ2QavKyKW2XrYKSTAsm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRggzmLhH8bfDmkdJg6n6CwbcDNXt6ebsC1TMbVx6fZ3u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ2inBFzvQLmNNR6CcWp4CnRskQ2QavKyKW2XrYKSTAsm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2PSLbxDrQhDcFRh1xfsWaXirLDnXE36YYH"], "tags": ["photography", "nature"], "extra": {}}

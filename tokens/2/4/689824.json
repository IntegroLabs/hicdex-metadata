In 2008 I tried a little changing the habit of Still Life Painting into little bit surrealistic. In 2008, i made this artwork using oil paint on the canvas with title Satu Sama.\n\nThis painting is made with a balanced composition and symmetry. The object is parallel to the middle and on the same average surface. It describes balance and equality, in red there is white, in white there is red, like Yin and Yang completed black and white that fills up and complements each other.\n\nThis work borrows the red and white onion legend that describes an evil figure as a red onion and a good figure as garlic. Shown that nothing is absolute, good and bad so relative. Above kindness there is always above crime, there must also kindness, because everything in nature must be balanced and paired.\n\nThrowback Artwork\n\"Satu Sama\"\nBy Fadhlil Abdi\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmegKhsr3EGb8dKQrrhV7e7CNrd5dnP8GzRKKxUYzrmgQ2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYPivqR2LDFveEB9x9q87SKL6vs8BDo9MCCoAcdNFJ3oP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmegKhsr3EGb8dKQrrhV7e7CNrd5dnP8GzRKKxUYzrmgQ2", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz28borFEokESF2JVrEadGAWQA7oG8shrfUJ"], "tags": ["Realist", "painting", "oilpaint"], "extra": {}}

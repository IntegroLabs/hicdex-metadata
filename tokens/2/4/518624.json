In the alps, at 1500 meters of altitude. This is the time of the year when winter is still present and when your heart craves the green grass from imminent spring.\n\nYou look down in the valley and wish for warmer temperatures soon.\n\nThis creation is a reminder to always live in the moment, no matter where you are in your life. There's an immense charm to winter and in spring but no less than the multitude of moments in between.\n\n\n\"I create artworks to express my emotions and make people think about how to become a better version of themselves.\"\n\n\"I believe in clean NFTs and love the Tezos community\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcpX3czgdca3SAwgyGEYPuCwpNFFsmjGmjdtX7TAhtjXL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYgS4S6HzyoZ31hMXDqvc8DZSGnmZsQ7Xw7FqkJ5TbXxN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcpX3czgdca3SAwgyGEYPuCwpNFFsmjGmjdtX7TAhtjXL", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VTxzdrte7XSRTN4N22nTqXUU3QXx3MqLh"], "tags": ["abstract", "landscape", "contemporary"], "extra": {}}

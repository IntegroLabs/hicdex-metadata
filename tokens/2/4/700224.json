In TWINS ARE PEOPLE TWO, we have a pun that works on two fronts. The main pun is referring that twins are people too, as if to intimate a previous sentence might have referenced that individual people who are not twins are indeed people and that also twins are people as well. The other pun is the literal sentence as you see it. The sentence is a factual statement, written in a little more creative way than just saying something like, \"Twins are two people.\" It's a bit more poetic and it just works, \"TWINS ARE PEOPLE TWO.\" ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ3SWPmHkGgnJtjwg4WBcZSeq1MEN7w9AYtVXg25YkNyT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfH6cuYVnaeE1HxfkysBp6ejczkYfbsQ9LTa2uATHLaee", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ3SWPmHkGgnJtjwg4WBcZSeq1MEN7w9AYtVXg25YkNyT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

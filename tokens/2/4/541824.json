I have been taking care of my parents since they've been in quarantaine because of Covid. I've been doing too much, sleeping too little and taking bad care of myself. After meditating i could see the patterns that were holding me back. I wanted to alter the image and show you how I felt, but after starting i had no energy to put into it, the image in my head would not come out with tubes draining the life out of me. The next day I realised that what i made was an exact metaphor for my state of being. The low energy, the drowziness, the inability to create is poured into this image. The lack of energy and effort shows. That's why I decided to upload it as it is right now.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbdeRFDdodduU9mqwVTR7H5jQ37zYh6Z8FfAfLquqnCwM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWfoMZtU4PDV3c5wXtBAfFREohmhBSmMcAFn7UtRZR7u1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbdeRFDdodduU9mqwVTR7H5jQ37zYh6Z8FfAfLquqnCwM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1S3J7kuYFho5QyhZ7czyDmoR8sU1nvGzMM"], "tags": ["meditation", "drained", "pabloslenders"], "extra": {}}

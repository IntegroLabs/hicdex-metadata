They are listeners and will whisper to people and animals to move them to a better path and to find balance in their lives.\n\n\nRarely ever seen by humans, the wingless dragons stick to the trees with all their length, their color becomes like the bark of the trees, blending in beautifully and almost completely.  You may look right at them, even touch one, and never realize it.  \n\nTheir role is to maintain the balance of the forest and of the world as a whole.\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZn9gNzJfEXK2rFTBoN7DFc2NiyNLVPo8HWCWVRe6UmPL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeYwuzQXes5cwijetaJmaPf6j2EX9e97yXibMCdiRZrA7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZn9gNzJfEXK2rFTBoN7DFc2NiyNLVPo8HWCWVRe6UmPL", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld", "dragon", "dragons"], "extra": {}}

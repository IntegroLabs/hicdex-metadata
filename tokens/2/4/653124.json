Don\u2019t ask me how I know I just do. My Maye has somehow contacted me. She and Nunanni are on their way here to the Lula Island!\u201d\n\nGracie asked, \u201cwhen will she arrive?\u201d \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d replied the Queen.

She didn\u2019t want that awful doctor getting his hands on her.\n\nhttps://gistlidia.xyz/mayes-on-her-way/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdR6VMq7KpDDkvP2W2uiRGff4Re8vEqrjfKsaiBr2Uooi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdR6VMq7KpDDkvP2W2uiRGff4Re8vEqrjfKsaiBr2Uooi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdR6VMq7KpDDkvP2W2uiRGff4Re8vEqrjfKsaiBr2Uooi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZhqH6bkJkfgdgJbWSnKhUuhPx8aaBV7TQ"], "tags": ["Queen", "Parucha", "gistlidia"], "extra": {}}

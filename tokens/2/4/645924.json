As the world, we are still in the grip of this disease. He took our loved ones from us. We encountered situations that we never expected. Perhaps we can say that it is one of the most negative cases in human history. What happened in quarantine, a world full of prohibitions, painful lives and painful waits in hospitals, many events that the human memory will never forget have taken place. I respectfully commemorate all the people who lost their lives in this epidemic", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPDFwT91UQaDNBpUqinHSr6dDx9ToVj41tkrd2MSVE6eA", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme58aw57BncTEfMvRNzRgq72N4ukCxMsN8ZDw4fR8FnVp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPDFwT91UQaDNBpUqinHSr6dDx9ToVj41tkrd2MSVE6eA", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1S7uCX8KyyCzfzRPr5gAMSzqEoQ3bruQCV"], "tags": ["Virus", "png", "tezos", "gnsstudio", "2d"], "extra": {}}

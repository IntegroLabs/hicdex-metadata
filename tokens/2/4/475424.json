{"__version": 1, "token_id": 475424, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "CONFLICTED", "description": "Political conflict, Racism, and Religion are just a marketing strategy, media snatches the truth, spreading slander and hatred, because the issue of Religion, Race, and Politics have a high price and value on the market. Politician, Government, Corporates and Military are cooperating hand in hand to build a company in the name of God and Nationalism. They deliberately create terror and disunity. Wars and terrors spent a very large amount of money, so they have to get the profits doubled. Actually, its all just a profit's calculation, its all just a dirty nasty business with a bigger scale and wider market. And of course, with a lot of sacrifices of lives.\n\n2016\nArtwork: Vidi Nurhadi Ranadipura\nPhotographer: Burhan Amaludin\n\nJPEG\n2831 x 2085 pixel\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZGL3NDdUcwQZgnRekj7BuRWvyQkcjTYuL6pgbDdzjCe5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWyLYfwfGW1hiJZihU7Y3kKFVHoYknYo43WZbbpUxiPt3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZGL3NDdUcwQZgnRekj7BuRWvyQkcjTYuL6pgbDdzjCe5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XEXE3YqNBYfWVentyoWhNA1FGcHpV64DC"], "tags": ["maternaldisaster", "maternaldisaster", "photography", "conflicted", "artinstallation", ""], "extra": {}}

This is the 16th letter in The Cool Alphabet, A is For Aloy. I've been a really big gamer  for much of my life but somehow when Horizon Zero Dawn came out in 2017 I completely missed it. I didn't end up playing it until last year when we were all stuck inside for covid and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! It's an open world, 3rd person post-apocalyptic  adventure filled with robotic beasts where the main character is an incredibly strong heroine named Aloy. She goes from being a total outcast to saving her people as well as the planet. Well the story continued and the sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, just came out. I'm only a few hours in but have already encountered several new robotic animals and it's taking me right back to the original game with the excitement of a whole new quest and mystery to unravel. Most new Playstation games have this photo feature that you can pause the game and enter a mode where you can rotate around your character, zoom in, change their facial expression, facial paint, photo filter and many other things and I spent some time crafting a portrait of Aloy and that is where this main image came from. It seems like an incredibly powerful tool to capture your favorite characters in unique ways.

Basically, I'm a traditional painter by using canvas and acrylic paint, but for my NFT project, I made digital version of artwork without losing style and soul like on canvas. So, Ihope with \"the prayer\", you can have standard to see my progress in digital art.\n\nThis work is inspired by my habits when to do something. I believe that every prayer has purity, hope and honesty from the deepest heart. i also believe that prayer always has the power in a magic way that can save us.\n\n\"The prayers\" is a representation of us, a creature of sin, the gamblers of reality, but never forget to pray.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmetxS8YaaBWGZomZc8VFoY4pj8sqA2U5uvxsDX7vG3ekv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUmtwDqKfA5SXHAwgX2acfsyQEwehTUFjn4NDzGRBCLEf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmetxS8YaaBWGZomZc8VFoY4pj8sqA2U5uvxsDX7vG3ekv", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz29vLDxXiXkU5SY75ebaCmkJRSUuMRrBUf2"], "tags": ["Montha", "DigitalPainting"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 640924, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Dead-Beautiful Woman", "description": "This unique and limited edition original raven NFT collection is the only collection made in the last century in which the entire poem, each verse is illustrated and recited one by one. In this painting, which is a part of The Raven NFT collection, the dead-beautiful woman allegory in the poem is discussed. Lenore's separation from life, where it is no longer possible to return, and the integration of death and its messenger with himself, appears as a symbol of pain, despair and annihilation. Nudity as a symbol of a divine journey, life-death dualism; the raven, the black bird and the metaphor of death; As a manifestation of light in the middle of heaven and hell, the composition represents Lenore's existence neither in heaven nor on earth. The shadow of the raven is not the shadow of man or of God in both poetry and painting. It is a matter of vaguely signified death. here, when the shadow speaks, not the voice of a single being is heard, but the intonations of the multitude; because it carries the accents of the dead-beautiful woman. It describes the transformation of the specific reality in its integrated state. This work, in which the raven poem is read with pictures, is unique in that it is the only collection created in this century.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUBCogywkKNbn4BzNQ67zLB3mUYpXCn1RZFe33PLk5LaK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR8g3V4bMb41EwdUiyFdYjqAxAwXAb35xjLGimnU4V8KD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUBCogywkKNbn4BzNQ67zLB3mUYpXCn1RZFe33PLk5LaK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iJxBLtEwiFmUpgD7PubY2qkoZcSg46z7y"], "tags": ["watercolorpainting", "illustration", "poe", "poem", "handmade", "nftcollections", "nftart", "nftcommunity", "nftartist", "nft", "allegory", "metaphor", "symbolism", "life", "death", "dualism", ""], "extra": {}}

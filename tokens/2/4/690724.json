Think of the whole piece as an album, and each fragment as a song ;)\n\nA visual diary that takes you on a walk with me through a city called Curitiba, in the south of Brasil. I was on summer vacation, spent most of my days smoking joints and wandering through the neighborhood. A lot goes on my mind when I see these images but I can't say it here.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CL2v3WKBLE4/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQC93E7fduDEGgUNV8vtAWRw6vhgeGReiiz3M3L5nZ2CM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYQ8umXas7jMoTLRHBi4crZDCxBgehrnsgmVwRAsf7nh5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQC93E7fduDEGgUNV8vtAWRw6vhgeGReiiz3M3L5nZ2CM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PtvQ8NA2ZAazJR351GSjvJ6GUcRTwn8Zs"], "tags": ["photography", "streetphotography", "fotografia", "colagem", "collage", "diary", "journal", "diario", "brasil", "brazil", "dxxx", "streetart", "art", "arte", "graffiti", "pixo", "cwb", "curitiba", "hicetnuncBR"], "extra": {}}

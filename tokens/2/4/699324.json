{"__version": 1, "token_id": 699324, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "March Madn3ss by thr33som3s - Orange thr33 friends OW10 -Insert #MMOW10", "description": "On March 17th, 2022, thr33som3s spent 2hrs 17min painting 64 individual 1/1 thr33 friends. Each painting was completed in one attempt with no visual reference of the featured animal friend. With no prior experience drawing or painting any of the animals (except cat and dog,) these are truly genesis offerings.  As all pieces were created from memory (admittedly, thr33som3s couldn't be certain he even knew what an aardvark looked like,) these paintings offer a rare glimpse inside the creative mind.\n\nAlso, this is a MADN3SS INSERT with limited Utility during the March Madn3ss Brack3t 3v3nt.\n\nThis token represents:  ORANGE Brack3t, West Quadrant, 10 Seed\n\nIn addition to all Standard Insert Utilities, this is also an ORANGE Insert.\n\n---\n\nSometimes thr33som3s needs to go dancing and take the whole Grotto with him.\n\nTo celebrate that quintessentially American sporting ritual, the Mens Collegiate Basketball Championship, thr33som3s debuted a new 3v3nt.  March Madn33ss tipped off on March 13th, 2022 with S3l3ction Sunday in The Grotto dropping a collection of 4 unique Brack3ts of 64 entries each.  Brack3t participants from The Grotto and the general public navigate three weeks of mens college basketball games to determine four Brack3t winners and an eventual 3v3nt Champion.\n\nAt the center of the 3v3nt, thr33som3s minted 256 individually hand-painted tokens to represent the 64 seeds in each of the 4 Brack3ts: Pink, White, Black, and Orange.  Though minted on a separate Madn3ss wallet, these tokens are offical thr33som3s and, as such, will have Future Utility.\n\nThis OBJKT is an individually conceived and hand painted piece.\n\n******* digital capture of original paintings, gouache on vintage baseball cards, 2022. ******* NFT image is for personal use, no commercial rights are granted.

This illustration is inspired by Allen Ginsberg:\n\u2019\u2019I don\u2019t do anything with my life except romanticize and decay with indecision\u2019\u2019.\nIt is about feeling like you are wasting your time romanticizing the past and being anxious about the future, while your life is passing by.\nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZiqb19NfrkGkL6jbhRDmoNAEHbMgSarhiSRpAP732Li9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcPNWj4PWEQEYCgMRhBpeZs69xkHXvG5BbTXkuY1bu77t", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZiqb19NfrkGkL6jbhRDmoNAEHbMgSarhiSRpAP732Li9", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours", "romantic"], "extra": {}}

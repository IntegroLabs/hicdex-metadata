The main form in the image is a watercolour painting of a squid on very wet paper. The paint spread out and blurred the boundary of the squid, to mimic quantum waves interfering. This was the source image for my very first (and probably the worlds first) experiment with quantum image making in 2019 (via IBM's devices).","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmW6UU6kf6yQtf77HNRUVNpmrhwhisNGLL5wo2m5KYWWJg","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1PmZBoHjyyF1L2GHLeCzZk5PC54zTGK2ek"],"tags":["quantum","digitalimage","collage","painting","watercolour","space"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmW6UU6kf6yQtf77HNRUVNpmrhwhisNGLL5wo2m5KYWWJg"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmZLkdgG9HpTcfF9KZVUDBLmDxoQunn2P7S3Z44SgqFrvz"},"supply":"100","transfered":157}

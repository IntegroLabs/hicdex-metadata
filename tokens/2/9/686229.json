The words HEROES and HERPES had this pitter patter between them. I couldn't put my finger on it at the moment, but it eventually hit me. It was the \"O\" of HEROES and the \"P\" of HERPES that made start to think of 2 other words that have this exact 2 word word ladder pitter patter. (say that last line fast 10 times...lol) The two other words that came to mind that have this pattern are ALOHA and ALPHA. I was curious to see what would happen if we put it all together. The result is what you see. I purposefully put the \"O\" words (ALOHA HEROES) on one line and the \"P\" words (ALPHA / HERPES) on the other. It is extremely rare to find words like this, at least as far as I've done the research for. Narratives could be made, but for what...logic? Logic shmogic who cares? This is interesting just for the thrill of the hunt. And let me tell you this was the unexpected hunt that I always wish to be woken up in the middle of the night to grab a pen and paper for.

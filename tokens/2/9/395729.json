{"__version": 1, "token_id": 395729, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "RICH BOY", "description": "In this work, the artist presents a surrealist vision with a social criticism generated by inequality in Latin America. Street children forced to work to contribute money at home, or in the worst cases as a result of child exploitation.\n\nThe main colors in the work represent the brand of an elitist clothing company, the same one that the main character dresses in an ironic way, while carrying a very common wooden box in Mexico, used to sell cigarettes and sweets in the streets.\n\nMost of the children who sell sweets in the cities come from rural towns.\n\nCopyright: By purchasing this NFT, you have the right to print it for personal use on t-shirts, mugs, or decorative images.

Even when a truth is out in the open, it still needs someone somewhere to experience it, absorb it, register it, accept it and thus becoming revealed. Nothing in our reality is apparent to us from birth; we learn through layers of indoctrination (good and bad). The universe is illusive to all of us and yet we participate in its mystery at every single moment. Through acquired knowledge and trust in empirical sciences, we collectively push the needle forward of what real truth is. There is a reason why REVEAL is on top and HIDDEN is on the bottom. In order to reveal a truth, we need to dig down (physically, mentally, spiritually, etc) to discover something about ourselves and/or our world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSPuhKztJQtpuLotmp9xnJkWRVQUyv6FfkCHPXiYadvFF", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd1Tsjo2LYrEc5ZrT9pk7gPkFC2ZHHbmFW62iTtfrFDxk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSPuhKztJQtpuLotmp9xnJkWRVQUyv6FfkCHPXiYadvFF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 674829, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "A SLIVER OF SILVER", "description": "A SLIVER OF SILVER uses the actual words SLIVER and SILVER to create a scene of a molten crucible smelting slivers of silver into metallic bars below. I suppose this could go under the umbrella of being an autological word also known as homological. (an autological word is a word that expresses a property that it also possesses.) Examples: word is a word, noun is a noun, English is English, etc. So by using \"sliver\" as slivers of silver itself and using \"silver\" to describe the bars of silver being poured, we've created a visual definition matrix of both words. Most words are \"heterological\" in nature, meaning they don't define themselves. Autological words can be fun to play with. So much so, that I'll be using more of these in the future to express some new ideas and concepts in the next volume of this book series. Oh and you've officially read 80% of this book! Mazel Tov to you for getting this far! Keep going...only 100 pages to go.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUtxwLum8FcRxC36wT3NQqRc9PU8EYFWmhCf9rJ1QfLEf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPQQS6U7eLpoDPbQJXXV6s9Wiq3xJADbfLdQaoW1y3F95", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUtxwLum8FcRxC36wT3NQqRc9PU8EYFWmhCf9rJ1QfLEf", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

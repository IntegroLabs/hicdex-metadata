Whether it's magic or some alien phenomena, no one knows where the rumors stem from, but rumors of inhuman spectacles of power have swirled in the new colony. Is it an effect of the strange new planet humanity finds itself living on, or its now gone previous inhabitants?  The powers are a double-edged sword; dangerous, both to those on the receiving end as well as the wielder themselves.  Citizens showing signs of these abilities are often ostracized and can expect a visit from the royal guards.","tags":["Vessels","LoreCard004"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmTMFiPvW1PxwJJg7aQWPLSrPSDKNsqCaWp3U7LSVWFjWr","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmTMFiPvW1PxwJJg7aQWPLSrPSDKNsqCaWp3U7LSVWFjWr","display_uri":"ipfs://QmNskkfiieC7utQnXXGY8jVQFUNmnvubgbVRDCQ98TVZ1o","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

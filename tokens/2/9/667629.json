Angkringan is an option to gather while eating and drinking at low prices. \nFood starts at a thousand and no more than 10 thousand. usually just covered with a tent and on the side of the road. but that's the atmosphere that makes angkringan has its own charm. if you go to Indonesia, and happen to be in the Yogyakarta area. \nPlease try! :)\n-\n-\n-3000X2000 px\n-500 dpi", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaiJs3ccnmL5yyhHBkXEUgStjdt4dVLBvXmDeGHB7FLjM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNbRcsHukFuoGrihNLg21WfZFqz8yWkVfoeRqnwKfgKmA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaiJs3ccnmL5yyhHBkXEUgStjdt4dVLBvXmDeGHB7FLjM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NZQVM6pwPYRgVqcrdAmTdpx2Pwxv7Ms81"], "tags": ["illustration", "javanese", "hangout", "psycedelic", "art", "ardhdwp", "local"], "extra": {}}

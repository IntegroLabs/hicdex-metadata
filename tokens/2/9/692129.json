There were two things that Midas cared most about in his life. His daughter and the gold. The Rich King has spent his days counting his treasure.\n\nOne day, while Midas was walking in the garden of his palace, he found a \nsleeping satyr named Silenus, who was a friend of God Dionyssus. The king took the satyr to the palace and hosted him for 3 days. When Dionyssus came to the palace to get his friend, the king gave a huge feast in the throne room for them. Dionyssus granted one wish to Midas for his good behavior. But the greedy king wished that everything he touches turns into gold. \n1/3\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZVZm4GwgX16fPSzyyfumnbj2HuVHsxbhicAhfJ6KJg1z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfG3vtGrGDB5nEUMHbQUWfCU2bsanBYtUUGjhFqof9gMh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZVZm4GwgX16fPSzyyfumnbj2HuVHsxbhicAhfJ6KJg1z", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dadtLsk3EjLTSWbdV4jFQyQ2gi3HGEB84"], "tags": ["3d", "digital", "midas", "midastouch", "king", "gold", "interior", "ancient", "feast", "wish", "myth", "mythology", "palace", "throneroom", ""], "extra": {}}

An omnipotent race known only as the primaries declares its power to save one of these civilizations from extinction. To earn the right to survive, each race must choose a champion strong enough to compete in a tournament to the death.  This is MAXIMUM PRIDE, the warrior chosen by the planet RAMO, as his is the general of its army. He possesses fantastic battle skills with sword and shield, and his shining armor protects him from elemental attacks.  Maximum's problem is his extreme pride, which can cause him to make fun of his opponents during battle and this leaves him open to attacks.  He likes to chew bubble gum to define his muscular jaw.  Only one warrior can emerge triumphant! Will it be him? Place your bets!

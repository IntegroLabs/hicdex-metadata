No longer in a time of open war, the gates are never locked and the village is often full of strangers on the road to Cadwell from Minuteâ€™s Harbour.   This tangle of hoary trees and dappled clearnings is home as much to covert merchant meetings as it is to children playing and the many tiny birds that live there.","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmW6ZNP98QqdQXM9Lz3q1e4FyBtsu8h1JfQtsy2bYeZCq9","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1UpCJ3qTWZoZwJuQWrZGZ5GZco9xBLjW8z"],"tags":["castle","map","cartography","embroidery","linen","silk","bamboo","stories","fantasy",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmW6ZNP98QqdQXM9Lz3q1e4FyBtsu8h1JfQtsy2bYeZCq9"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://Qmeuwcd7wzdUAdnsLCKnGZq3GwhbP4SNiuVc35t6Rzzxmj"},"supply":"9","transfered":8}

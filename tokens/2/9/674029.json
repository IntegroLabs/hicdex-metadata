I thought it's madness, and politely refused, I found it too dangerous not only because of people, but so many wild animals, insects and diseases, specially that on the bicycles cannot take food supplies, water... He later took the trip in cars, and I felt I lost an unique chance to photograph one of the most unspoiled places on earth.\nYet the truth is that modernisation is rapidly spreading there as well, and tourists - mostly photographers in search of an authentic experience could see the time turning back in front of their eyes, as people throw their modern clothing and rapidly paint themselves in pursuit of photo money. Often ancient traditions and rituals are kept only to attract tourists, as in an income source. Is a weird game modern life is something so seductive, yet we never felt more alienated, unhappy..most people work an entire year to spend their two free weeks somewhere in nature, or connect with friends and family, maybe to feel what our ancestors felt in every day of their life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQNjfFUPMgGKcSpeAZAhrw6pWhEKUoSVwxFtwjvmqvrdG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTM4gKNaCGyXzLT9WZwR7zKpHLajVSezZEvHEBxFVW2gT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQNjfFUPMgGKcSpeAZAhrw6pWhEKUoSVwxFtwjvmqvrdG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e2iUmhoRUMfR5jrLsvEmvewRFZfuiNL9h"], "tags": ["Illustration", "character", "art", "painting", "drawing", "nft", "cryptoart", "modernart", "surreal"], "extra": {}}

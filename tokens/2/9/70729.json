The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","tags":["cca","generative","random","gif"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmWUXUxfFp9rJ1khp6W4WEECgGUAAmm8yZEBhHVE4x65MA"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmWUXUxfFp9rJ1khp6W4WEECgGUAAmm8yZEBhHVE4x65MA","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

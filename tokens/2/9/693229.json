{"__version": 1, "token_id": 693229, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "HOUSE OF BLUES / BLOUSE OF HUES", "description": "Spoonerisms are kind of a type of anagram. They rearrange the first couple of letters between 2 separate words, not the entire word like a true anagram; think of it as a distant cousin, lol. In the case of HOUSE OF BLUES, we can move the \"H\" from HOUSE and switch it with the \"BL\" from BLUES, thus producing the spoonerism of BLOUSE OF HUES. An interesting fun fact to this wordplay is that both lines use or relate to a concept of color; BLUES / HUES. Coincidence? Possibly, but everything can be a coincidence in language from a certain distance or at least articulated as a vast network of intertwined archaic algorithms. I experimented with the thickness, depth, and colors of the connecting lines to play with concepts of complimentary and contradiction.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdKwVm7HXb5LaffMB7L9tfR2pR4U6Bs66NyyqV5Wx2bnZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdLsBYXc2oqUokrXbruK9gpvsa5PDLwnS16AzbFRgoCSz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdKwVm7HXb5LaffMB7L9tfR2pR4U6Bs66NyyqV5Wx2bnZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

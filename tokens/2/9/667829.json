Sometimes it is genetic, inherited from the tradition of rigid parents and ancestors, believers or atheists. Like a virus, it spreads by mutating rapidly, and deceives us by disguising itself as reasons, virtue and moral superiority. It becomes a deadly disease when it metastasizes and invades the key organs of our social body, which cannot be removed without risk to life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQLszTK9sAUgyRNBRGsVRDD579Ew1mhZrcWCedSQ6hmuR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeBtMWjbNCuN8hDbY4LrdUZUEdjyJdjufDezCfWWTqKpM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQLszTK9sAUgyRNBRGsVRDD579Ew1mhZrcWCedSQ6hmuR", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hwwFv6hWdxfWPQQea58NFFJGtFGiVWGTa"], "tags": ["3d", "virus", "nft", "animation", "art"], "extra": {}}

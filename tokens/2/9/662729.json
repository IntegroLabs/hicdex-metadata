Although he is said to rule alongside the princess, he is a figure that is absent in the video game series. However, he does make somewhat notable appearances in other early media such as the Nintendo Comics System, Nintendo Adventure Books, and the Asian-drawn strategy guide illustrations for Super Mario Bros.. He is also mentioned on Princess Toadstool's profile in a 1993 character guide produced by Nintendo of America.\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me, everybody! I just closed the peanut butter jar on my tie.

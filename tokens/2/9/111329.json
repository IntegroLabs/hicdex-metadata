The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","tags":["generative","wolfram","random","gif","cca"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmXVjtk2BXRqZjBNmLyn7a48oWysDfJvFGtmbYe9wEy9oo"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXVjtk2BXRqZjBNmLyn7a48oWysDfJvFGtmbYe9wEy9oo","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXVjtk2BXRqZjBNmLyn7a48oWysDfJvFGtmbYe9wEy9oo","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

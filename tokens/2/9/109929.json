Botnets have been around for years now, but thanks to the recent widespread use of the Internet of Things, this method of attack seems to be experiencing a second youth. We have witnessed the large-scale and sudden infection of devices whose IT security has never been contemplated and for which there was no dedicated antivirus. These devices tracked down others of the same type that could infect them and so this army of zombies, called together by the Mirai malware (which in Japanese means “future”) has grown bigger and bigger, waiting to receive instructions.

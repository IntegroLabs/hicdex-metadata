The subjects are replaced with people of color and the inanimate objects are replaced with classic cameras. This is a play on the classic C'est Ne Pas Un Pipe image. I replaced the pipe with a classic rangefinder camera.","tags":["photography","magritte","reimagined","Treachery","cestnepas","surrealist","photo","fraternity","diversity","pipe","cest","rangefinder"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmbVBZoANsfFqTDszqqUYw2CxJ2Fqwk8niUW9d2oUXKhNq"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmbVBZoANsfFqTDszqqUYw2CxJ2Fqwk8niUW9d2oUXKhNq","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

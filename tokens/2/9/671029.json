The simulation can be stopped at specific moment and downloaded as a GLB file, to be explored in this app (find more info at www.lumicles.xyz). \nCheck the help icon to learn how to control the cameras to navigate through the cloud and change the visualization parameters.\n\nThe app is not designed for mobile, event though it may run in some devices, mid to high end GPU is recommended\nTwitter: @fedemarino31 | Instagram: fedemarino31\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQuHpnSrWHTy9cA124rPwVvZXVowxJ1C1tM7CPDFZHe57", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTXuMuivHqJVBVapuQE3gjAtdsULZauPRmkA5a8KCfN77", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQuHpnSrWHTy9cA124rPwVvZXVowxJ1C1tM7CPDFZHe57", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SM8dDPHmeB1QGMdRo3SsysZxvyfDnczdn"], "tags": ["generativeart", "WebGL", "Three.js", "interactiveOBJKT", "particles", "creativecoding", "GPGPU", "simulation", "real-time", "abstractart", "GLSL", "shaders", "3DArt", "Javascript"], "extra": {}}

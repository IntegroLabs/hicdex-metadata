{"name": "Smolest Seascape 2", "description": "Smol version of my own photograph taken back in 2015. As an islander i have a very different relation with nature. There isnt a day i am not inside an olive grove, visiting a beach or taking a stroll to the footpaths of my island. A vast network of footpaths used to be the \"roads\" of Paxos before cars. These footaths today are used for trekking or during olive harvest. On this photograph i am on the west side of the island on one of these footpaths. When i noticed a smol boat coming from the north, i waited for the moment he was passing under the setting sun to get its figure and the golden seascape. 16x16px George Angelis 2021.", "tags": ["bbSmol", "smol", "pixel", "bbseries", "pixelart", "experiment", "colors", "pixel", "abstract", "smolexception", "smolgang", "smolPhotography", "boat", "sun", "sea", "seascape", "goldenhour"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmfWtjgVyJyRzqrKju677m8vJUb9WTV8S3k5fdgPsHTD88", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmShyD4ikvqZtheZ2TcBzqSDFvPSgZ1PARsCexKYy5vSi9", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1eJyuKHtG5Z2jxdJVywu86qu7PxXzbpcuY"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfWtjgVyJyRzqrKju677m8vJUb9WTV8S3k5fdgPsHTD88", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

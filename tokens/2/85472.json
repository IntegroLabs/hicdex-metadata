He looked sad that day. Two days later he stopped eating. They thought he was going to die, but he didn't. One of the few images of him wearing clothes. They put clothes from the caretaker's son on it, but Juca systematically refused to wear clothes. I think they hit him before that photo. Search \"captive gray\" un Youtube for more info. Regards.

These nightmares/dreams happened in between 1970s, 1980s and 1990s by a Japanese writer named Hiroko Nishikawa. They were partially implemented by producer Osamu Sato in original LSD. The nature of these nightmares/dreams are extremely odd, and some even have outright uncovered sexual references.","tags":["lsd","dream","journal","dream","emulation"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/webp","uri":"ipfs://QmP96kdKDy28Up4U5NnWfmGSkqb8BaSg35ShKkjwwfkH6a"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmP96kdKDy28Up4U5NnWfmGSkqb8BaSg35ShKkjwwfkH6a","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVgnyTKod4w2sgezRZooHzKDBdi6nhhLARdzsAcG2vxTP","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

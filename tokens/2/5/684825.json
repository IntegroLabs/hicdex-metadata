The plant signifies beginnings, growth, eco friendliness, and the concept of nurturing what we love.\n\nEverlasting Building has a very unique and awe inducing style, inspired by architecture, photography, and liminal spaces.\n\n\"It comes from my backgrounds both as a photographer and an architect. I always looked for ways of mixing architecture with different art forms, how a space can convey a story for example, or how it could be portrayed through different media. Liminal spaces are an amazing subject in that matter. They are a transitional space. A threshold. Like in a story, the interesting part happens between the setup and the resolution.\" - EverlastingBuilding", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS3tdXgFAMD3zK1AKh1yPeDnTH5uiTnzf3QXd9KSiMY3b", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc1AXGoZFZdBdZwNCnx2eRhJizV6et7L8d4auq4y9bvvT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS3tdXgFAMD3zK1AKh1yPeDnTH5uiTnzf3QXd9KSiMY3b", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YEYsb7nCUZXvVmGe3KDUECc7TR8DE8QUd"], "tags": ["everlasting", "building", "gather", "plant", "art", "liminal", "liminalspace"], "extra": {}}

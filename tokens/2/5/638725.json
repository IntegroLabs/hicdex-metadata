Rescanned from CRT TV.\n\nThe Amusement Park Collection was born in a fleamarket where I found a promotional VHS tape of a popular amusement park. From there, I searched for more vintage tapes and started the analog processing. However, a few days later, I felt that it was still a bit shallow so I started on a new research path. I began looking into Reddit themeparks and rollercoasters communities and, as a continuation of that, I joined Discord servers where I met great and passionate rollercoaster enthusiasts that helped me to discover lots of cool rides. It has been a great journey.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTcYu4G4UomQ3HMjbnA6uEQAxY8uwbZ7T25wLXLiuLGoS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTcYu4G4UomQ3HMjbnA6uEQAxY8uwbZ7T25wLXLiuLGoS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTcYu4G4UomQ3HMjbnA6uEQAxY8uwbZ7T25wLXLiuLGoS", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Rn6tv2B8pHpDaRWUruRf2MwiGJCX3reME"], "tags": ["analog", "glitchart", "glitch", "amusementpark"], "extra": {}}

OBJKT 105241 'Temple Lanterns' had a mobile loading error, so I sent OBJKT 106849 'Temple Lanterns (Mobile Available)' to all collectors who bought it. (Both items were 0 tez)   Two of 'Temple Lanterns' might be shown in my collection until I find the 2 collectors without no profile as of June 3, 2021, but I NEVER INTENDED DOUBLE MINTING!  I hope the remaining 2 collectors PqvUo and DCmRy burn 105241 soon. I am giving away OBJKT #110368 'Bye, 105241' as a limited gift to collectors who kindly burned the 105241.    As an artist and collector, I am also struggling in my current situation, and I am doing my best to solve this problem. I hope there would be no more misunderstood. Thank you for your understanding.","tags":["Urgent","notice","to","unknown","collectors","please","burn","105241","and","get","110368","thankyou","from","artistjoyjo","joyjo"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmQe6ZEiGXUChJ8HaVY2gnzukMaETC1HVt6qXBnai8z9eN"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQe6ZEiGXUChJ8HaVY2gnzukMaETC1HVt6qXBnai8z9eN","display_uri":"ipfs://QmUv9k9iW8mMdYMiZzk2sLwqA3RvmmmqLMGUYiKYdNYwP5","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

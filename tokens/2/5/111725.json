OBJKT 105241 'Temple Lanterns' had a mobile loading error, so I sent OBJKT 106849 'Temple Lanterns (Mobile Available)' to all collectors who bought it. (Both items were 0 tez)   Two of 'Temple Lanterns' might be shown in my collection until I find the 2 collectors without no profile as of June 3, 2021, but I NEVER INTENDED DOUBLE MINTING!  I hope the remaining 2 collectors PqvUo and DCmRy burn 105241 soon. I am giving away OBJKT #110368 'Bye, 105241' as a limited gift to collectors who kindly burned the 105241.

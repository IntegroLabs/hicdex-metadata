Now, half a century later, as I share these in a digital marketplace full of artists hawking their wares, I hope these photos remind us all of the humanity behind the transactions. Penang Cart: This photo was taken in Penang, Malaysia, circa 1969.","tags":["photo","photography","vietnam","penang","malaysia","1969"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmPJiZmcfWsh1B2Vf9rx4jJvTvZWhsjnyfbJukxqQJKJsw"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPJiZmcfWsh1B2Vf9rx4jJvTvZWhsjnyfbJukxqQJKJsw","display_uri":"ipfs://QmfWmeuei7tQbRaWy4jXFC5Jt2qwVZ6B7ppMa6sTcJ4p2d","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

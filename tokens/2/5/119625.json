{"name": "Fallantes Predators", "description": "Did you know that many butterflies are brilliantly colored? There are often ultraviolet patterns in the wings that we cannot see, but which may be seen by other butterflies. Coloration of the wings assists in deceiving predators into thinking they're bigger than they really are. Some wings have large \"eyespots\" which make the butterfly or moth look like the face of a larger animal (like an owl), scaring away some predators.", "tags": ["nfts", "100HEN", "#100HEN", "digitalart", "photography", "twitter:@4kurious", ""], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmQTbB5Ln9PAPXcFEoCsgbEdrJcxX8VX4HsRf3V4ouN9sY", "displayUri": "ipfs://Qmdpy6KST7jPZCmhCSt68iThx4o8mvDQek9SERoHyJiKhm", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1QJ1a1duESp5t9czSLQSQjH8dcbiHweeY9"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQTbB5Ln9PAPXcFEoCsgbEdrJcxX8VX4HsRf3V4ouN9sY", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

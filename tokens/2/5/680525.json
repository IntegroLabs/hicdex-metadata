This is the 17th letter in The Cool Alphabet, L Is For Link. I didn't buy my Switch immediately upon it coming out but when I DID finally get a Switch I bought it specifically to play Breath Of The Wild. It is not only one of the best Zelda games ever made but one of the best games ever made \u2014 PERIOD! Link, the silent protagonist, has some of the same tools he has always had BUT in addition his bag of weapons, clothing, abilities, tools and goodies is more expansive than ever before. The map is COMPLETELY open world. You can more or less wander anywhere with no linear path so in that respect it is unlike any Zelda game that has ever been made. Link has FOREVER been one of my gaming heroes and I CANNOT wait for the 2nd installment to be released!

Beautiful and just, he was the favourite of the gods. Most legends about him concern his death. Icelandic stories tell how the gods amused themselves by throwing objects at him, knowing that he was immune from harm. The blind god Had, received by the evil Lake, killed Balder by hurling mistletoe, the only thing that could hurt him. After Balder\u2019s funeral, the giantess Th\u00f6kk, probably Loki in disguise, refused to weep the tears that would release Balder from death.\n\nNorse mythology\n.Odin\n.Thor\n.Loki\n.Freya\n.Baldur\n.Frigg", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY8h6QHVRy2tgKy3JYNBnkMnmgCntVmKopCBxScSMjw5d", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY8h6QHVRy2tgKy3JYNBnkMnmgCntVmKopCBxScSMjw5d", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY8h6QHVRy2tgKy3JYNBnkMnmgCntVmKopCBxScSMjw5d", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R4FrYfMq3J2hRxaanXSH7A1GRR9Sms6ZN"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}

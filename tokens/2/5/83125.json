He's one of my most beloved friends. He's been here illegally, working for contractors and ranchers for 26 years without proper representation as a citizen. At 64 he still works construction and paints. This is one of my tributes to the man who represents so many others in his situation.","tags":[""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmecVVhgcd9owzDRhvxRaWADMQWbh94b5ja26RiZHTwuKV"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmecVVhgcd9owzDRhvxRaWADMQWbh94b5ja26RiZHTwuKV","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

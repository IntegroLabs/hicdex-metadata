V", "description": "So much can been framed in the narrative that skateboarding so freely provides; determination, hard work, craft, skill, free-thinking, innovation, friendship, community, etc. One attribute that is imbued into most skateboarders is a certain level of toughness and pain tolerance. Every moment of every day, somewhere in the world skateboarders are at war against gravity. We fall...a lot. As a result of falling so much, we individually figure out better fall tactics and patterns as mitigation strategies. This is a poem about taking risks and falling. We don't fail, we fall; and when we fall we get right back up and try again. Keeping going and do not stop! Keep learning. Keep innovating. Keep pushing boundaries. Keep the culture alive. Skateboarding is a gift to humanity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQz1Eo1AEuY3jZLjPjwDWrEvVCKhF6nvKgmEAA2iaprNk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQkyaHry69Ks9XvN6MDk8zqh9UY9HqRDDv2Yq5mgovJts", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQz1Eo1AEuY3jZLjPjwDWrEvVCKhF6nvKgmEAA2iaprNk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

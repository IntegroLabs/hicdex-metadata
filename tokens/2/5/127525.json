Skittles is a slightly larger than average Fluffle with common coat, colors, tail and frill.  Skittles is as vibrant a personality as their colors suggest! They enjoy an active scene, loud music, loads of attention and as much adventure as can be managed in any single day. This fluffle does not do well with downtime and is highly prone to destructive behavior if left to boredom. Skittles last owner was forced to file bankruptcy to cover the destruction after they took a few days off to recover from the flu. Please have a back up care taker in mind incase of sick days or injury.","tags":["Skittles","seafluffle","adoptable","collectable"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmXqjiqid2xty8aGqY2jAvY9nMQdu8Gb7YD1VsbhRrJiGR","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXqjiqid2xty8aGqY2jAvY9nMQdu8Gb7YD1VsbhRrJiGR","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXqjiqid2xty8aGqY2jAvY9nMQdu8Gb7YD1VsbhRrJiGR","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

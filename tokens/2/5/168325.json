This year they did not have the traditional Olympic torch relay all over the world.  Due to COVID the torch relay was confined to just Japan.  So, I am a few friends, each made an extra special NFT for a virtual torch relay.  \n\nMine represents the moment the torch is passed from one runner to the next.  To quote the song \"Pass It On' by Kurt Kaiser  \"It only takes a spark to get a fire going and then all those around can warm up in it's glowing\".  I hope #HENsports sets Hic Et Nunc ABLAZE and brings our community to a whole new level!

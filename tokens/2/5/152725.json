{"__version": 1, "token_id": 152725, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Bridges", "description": "\u201cSometimes I think I live in a gap between two worlds, one world that I have to wake up to, be adherent of the rules and live in a place that is dictated by others. A place I sometimes feel the fear of aging and dying before I have figured out what it is I am here to do. That other world is sweet, fresh and misty, inviting adventure into the unknown, melding ancient wisdom with new discovery; the sunlight turning into moonlight and the spell of eternal life is never broken. Perhaps in that gap I should repair the forgotten bridge from one side to the other, but truth be told, I don't want to. I don't want to because I don't have the energy to fix what is broken within. I am a wild, wandering nomad, I belong everywhere and nowhere all at the same time, and in that gap between worlds, I am free.\u201d \u2015 Riitta Klint", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcD1J3B3tdDT4veuCqUGBgrnDtv1jdBvDTNhcCydSJ8TN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY6Zu8qdekJaBY7LDv3oLD5ajCYWwLkwh2oN7L1Myfynt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcD1J3B3tdDT4veuCqUGBgrnDtv1jdBvDTNhcCydSJ8TN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Rfg2WCNpMaHhNSgmUUNgrAra3W4GUTicG"], "tags": ["red", "collage", "city", "digital", "collage"], "extra": {}}

How about, 'DID I DIE? I, I'VE DECEIVED. I DIED. As if waking up from death to life to only realize you're actually dead. What if life is actually like this? A dubious prospect at best, but an interesting momentary thought exercise. The only word within this narrative that is present is: \"I\". The ego deceives the senses into thinking it exists outside of itself. Like a life-long game of deception, we pretend, we deceive only to lose in the end.

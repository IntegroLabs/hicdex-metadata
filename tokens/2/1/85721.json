This is the first cake ever created dedicated to the nft's, it's a real cake photographed in April 2021, when the first nft's boom was front page news, along with an incredible number of emerging artists were selling their work at incredible prices, it is something we had to celebrate the rise of all our artist friends all over the world. While on the other hand many people started to proclaim themselves \"artists\" believing that NFT'S were just a way to make easy money, and ignoring that what makes NFT'S amazing is the collaborative community that is part of the platforms and our work that is based on our passion for creating and not for the money.","tags":["BYELECTRA","ADRIANAMORAM"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmaN47VAfWs8Ji8vCfikNs5fV1S99vBa1FL9WScekftf1N"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaN47VAfWs8Ji8vCfikNs5fV1S99vBa1FL9WScekftf1N","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

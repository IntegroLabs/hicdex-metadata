It was thoroughly (and tiredly, and admiringly, and lazily, and half-asleep, and amused, and excited, and dreamy, and impatiently, and ...) collected using SHIFT+s in the VLC Media Player and diligently (and tiredly, and admiringly, and lazily, and half-asleep, and amused, and excited, and dreamy, and impatiently, and ...) cropped in GIMP.\n\nMy film will most probably be in black and white, but I discovered a variety of very beautiful & intense red~orange, blue~grey and gold~yellow (& occasionally a bit of faint green) of which you get a glimpse here.\n\n:: {2022} :: @annaxmalina :: annamalina.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaAWkxGzJYHD8VvnMtYtaaeD2344t7ht4Lat93RBRaNHR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaAWkxGzJYHD8VvnMtYtaaeD2344t7ht4Lat93RBRaNHR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaAWkxGzJYHD8VvnMtYtaaeD2344t7ht4Lat93RBRaNHR", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Up3Uyj6PR3AkdsaXouhhetS3VdaTkW2Ro"], "tags": ["gif", "animation", "gan", "girlsgang", "annamalina"], "extra": {}}

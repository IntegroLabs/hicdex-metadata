{"__version": 1, "token_id": 680321, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Lucid Dream", "description": "A lucid dream is a type of dream where the dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming. During a lucid dream, the dreamer may gain some amount of control over the dream characters, narrative, or environment; however, this is not actually necessary for a dream to be described as lucid.\nLucid dreaming has been studied and reported for many years. Prominent figures from ancient to modern times have been fascinated by lucid dreams and have sought ways to better understand their causes and purpose[citation needed].\nMany different theories have emerged as a result of scientific research on the subject and have even been shown in pop culture[citation needed]. \nFurther developments in psychological research have pointed to ways in which this form of dreaming may be utilized as a form of sleep therapy.\nCultivating the dreamer's ability to be aware that they are dreaming is central to both the ancient Indian Hindu practice of Yoga nidra and the Tibetan Buddhist practice of dream Yoga. The cultivation of such awareness was a common practice among early Buddhists.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPH3YEuXzhdTamdsXcNTJ2HKzHqCDfNzSJi7The4gTeeB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPH3YEuXzhdTamdsXcNTJ2HKzHqCDfNzSJi7The4gTeeB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPH3YEuXzhdTamdsXcNTJ2HKzHqCDfNzSJi7The4gTeeB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dWC1aKp8vfiFBAC7tZSigyTiumVrWFcwM"], "tags": ["luciddream", "yoga", "meditation", "buddhism", "nidra", "tibetan", "digitalart", "minimalart", "abstractart", "lucid", "psychology", "psychedelic", "dream"], "extra": {}}

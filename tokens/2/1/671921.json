Take a seat in the waiting room and watch the time fly. \n\nNotes: Waiting Room 2 is a continuation of my \"Objects from Another Reality\" series, a collection of video game titles, books, architectural plans, advertisements, and other materials sourced from a strange alternate reality.\n\nFormat: GIF\nDimensions: 2048 x 1364", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT1TGYUPBYFMqXwsqX1Jj8KivJx21W29Zp7vrn2p4ny18", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT1TGYUPBYFMqXwsqX1Jj8KivJx21W29Zp7vrn2p4ny18", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT1TGYUPBYFMqXwsqX1Jj8KivJx21W29Zp7vrn2p4ny18", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1NbFeTRxDGzAkdYjNVihUcdaLoxjUT5mxc"], "tags": ["videogame", "gaming", "ghostshoes", "retro", "nostalgia", "humor", "90s", "weird"], "extra": {}}

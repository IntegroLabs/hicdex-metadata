This is an image from a few years ago, from the bedroom I think will forever have had the greatest sunsets of all the other bedrooms I have lived in.\n\nThe depth, richness, and beauty expressed by such an everyday occurrence is wonderfully inspiring. Taking the time to sit by the camera watching the dregs of the day fade away is often one of the most relaxing moments of the day.\n\n| 3888x2592px | f/1.8, 1/1250, 50mm | Canon 400D and Lightroom | Photographed 6th August 2018, Brighton |", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ5Th2CubWFsaDfDcHMwtM2zDHhkUXyEqqZs53mNHjgeZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU2ADZfi7fVPvEBkoeDuXZXiRBFcH16Jvv4wAYN1RNSNC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ5Th2CubWFsaDfDcHMwtM2zDHhkUXyEqqZs53mNHjgeZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1T9mwfpXQJqb5LJ2CZ6sd69K9vyo6xEPLW"], "tags": ["sunset", "photography", "redclouds", "sillhouette"], "extra": {}}

July 12 or 13, 100 BC to March 15, 44 BC) was a politically adept and popular leader of the Roman Republic who significantly transformed what became known as the Roman Empire by greatly expanding its geographic reach and establishing its imperial system. Allegedly a descendant of Trojan prince Aeneas, Caesarâ€™s birth marked the beginning of a new chapter in Roman history. By age 31, Caesar had fought in several wars and become involved in Roman politics. After several alliances, he became dictator of the Roman Empire, a rule that lasted for just one year before his death.","tags":["art","artist","director","human","creative","beauty","story","love","coy","photo","photographer","photography","magazine","concept","conceptual","number","one","great","amazing","gold","winner","win","peymannaderi","dark","portrait","fine"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmZu75DA9RTHZVUxzaeifoMQQJm8U6cz4ME9HTKgKoUBvH","mimeType":"image/jpeg"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZu75DA9RTHZVUxzaeifoMQQJm8U6cz4ME9HTKgKoUBvH","display_uri":"ipfs://QmbhuKMeU6mpi8mM8iW1zRULFL9d8YFjagLuYfkw8kg9yB","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

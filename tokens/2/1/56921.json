The car will be going back to auction soon and I just wanted to create a piece as a way to archive the experience. My grandfather passed away before seeing it completed and in some ways, it's a way to just record that it happened. A piece of family history.","tags":["MorrisOxford","Family","Love","Memories",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://Qmdkr8fjRsNnuoZNwu8KHUCfp2RzYufMpWYYouTUA3aQWS"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmdkr8fjRsNnuoZNwu8KHUCfp2RzYufMpWYYouTUA3aQWS","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

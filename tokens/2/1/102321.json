It would encapsulate lot of memories and moments one would had at that moment rather than the captured moment too.

All reminded and made you go revisit the time with a photograph.","tags":["photography","sea","india","beach","memory","photograph","photographers","landscape","nature","human","people"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmeMex1hfPiY472SatM3LFBBE7STHNDNuRoPefAZBZa7rz"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmeMex1hfPiY472SatM3LFBBE7STHNDNuRoPefAZBZa7rz","display_uri":"ipfs://QmXRDFA9u8wXvohqpu4bcLRPonAr1HL7PfvKbZSyLCKyiY","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

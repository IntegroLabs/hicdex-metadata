First, I thought \u2615\ufe0fcoffee\u2615\ufe0f would be great to look at (most of us need caffeine always). Then next, I thought I'd want to see an ancient object - something very old.\n\nDog\u016b is a kind of Jomon ritual object made during the late J\u014dmon period of prehistoric Japan (ca. 10,500\u2013ca. 300 B.C.). \n\nThe model of the work is a Yamagatadog\u016b \u5c71\u5f62\u571f\u5076, 2000-1000 BC, from Sakura-shi, Chiba, Japan. The original Dog\u016b is in the collection of Meiji University Museum, Japan.\n\nI made this work with respect for prehistoric culture.\n\n(no tracing any photographs)\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmezeGmqCxD1XFm9Mt2RbeC7WQJx4vrLNqv4i6aoNFkfa9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYsKWDbkANV28qxnacDeDhkEz1HW8hypSmWechpMPNoHe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmezeGmqCxD1XFm9Mt2RbeC7WQJx4vrLNqv4i6aoNFkfa9", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz29R9NbPtKT21x5zHHavikmUX6UMnzWheQW"], "tags": ["Japanese", "dogu", "Dog\u016b", "illustration", "ancient", "prehistory", "watercolor", "respect"], "extra": {}}

It was entirely done with stock photos and used as a cover illustration (hence the empty spaces, reserved for text) for a special report by the newspaper \"Folha de S. Paulo\", called \"The Information Era\". This picture is a reasonable sampling of the most common personal devices of its time. It looks visually poor by today's standards, but was hard to make nonetheless.

It is one of the most outstanding works of Spanish-American architecture. It was built, according to the plans of the Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega, who was inspired by Spanish cathedrals, around a church that was erected on the site shortly after the Spanish conquest of Tenochtitl\u00e1n. Construction began in 1573, was completed on the interior in 1667 and on the exterior until 1813.\n\nIt took almost 250 years to build it at is entirety. Because of that extensive construction period, allowed the integration of the diverse architectural styles that were in force and in vogue during those centuries: Gothic, Baroque, Churrigueresque, Neoclassical, among others.

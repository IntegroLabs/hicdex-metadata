I've been involved in the NFT space for just under 6 months and that doesn't really seem like that much time but as people always say time in this space is highly condensed. And in that time I have spent alot of time being part of some great communities AND learning how to grow and build a successful organic environment. So recently I have been offered a Community Manager position at a company to help rebuild and reframe the social media and discord for this company. It is an interesting proposition but the more I looked into the company and the NFT platform the more red flags and concerns became apparent for me. From an outside POV the platform looks a mess and visiting their current discord it's just a slew of complaints and customer service questions and concerns. So it doesn't look good. I've scheduled a meeting with the founder next week to try and get a better feel for what they might be doing to fix the platform but I'm also concerned that the true status of the platform might be spun into something it's not. How do you know if what someone is saying is true or if they're just spinning you right round baby right round like a record baby, right round, right round!!!??? I think the first step is looking them in the eyes and being 100% candid about how the platform looks from the outside.

I am not ashamed that we are looking for and destroying the fascists of the 21st century who live on the territory of our neighboring state. I am not ashamed of the fact that we have been waiting for 8 years and asked not to bomb the LPR and DPR, where thousands of people died. You are asking Putin to \"stop the war\", but what did you do when Putin asked Ukraine about it? They spat in his face when he spoke about the Minsk agreements. And he was tired. And I'm tired. We have 27 million victims of World War II with us. Now we are going after the fascists who survived. #I'm not ashamed #I'mnotashamed", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXTz18q5CXEcFostwfzXH58SR8Y7ngNzBqAgVdcbF2V2x", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaL6R4nsWjTWpur9GZ43zrPJ7SRN9sxeZRVh4TZ9PEUqR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXTz18q5CXEcFostwfzXH58SR8Y7ngNzBqAgVdcbF2V2x", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RxgDBVX5p6vNjtiyQRkGtzbat9cR5S3qm"], "tags": ["Ukrain", "Russia"], "extra": {}}

Pride means a lot of different things to many people. For us, pride is political and enjoyable, it stands for the opposite of shame and stigma, and it will keep changing and adapting in the future. Pride is not going anywhere - it will be there for you, whoever and wherever you are.\n\n- This is a message from Rebel Berries. You are not alone. For personal non-commercial use.

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 658622, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ONE DAY / DAY ONE", "description": "ONE DAY / DAY ONE is meant to be a motivational artwork for those artists out there that have that one idea that they know they COULD do if only they had ___________ excuse. I'm going to talk directly to you. Yes you. And I'm going to sound like an ornery old man, but tomorrow is not guaranteed. Look at how crazy the world is. In this life, all that actually exists is NOW. Whatever idea is in your head, write it down right now. No for real, put the book down and pick up and pen/pencil/whatever and write it down or just do it! I'll wait.........................................................ok awesome. How do you feel now? Better? The act of creation or creating is magical. You are literally willing something into existence; something no one has ever seen before potentially. Your work is important, even if it doesn't sell, go viral, or add to your success. Everything is a learning opportunity; make mistakes. Make a shit painting on purpose. Write awful poetry. Get every single idea out (even the bad and just out right garbage ones) and eventually you'll see what you've been waiting for. What do you think half of this book is about? I'm just getting all the ideas in my head out. Some are really, really powerful. Some are probably ok in your opinions. Some probably are deserving of either facepalms or eye rolls. Make ONE DAY into DAY ONE! If this doesn't motivate you...I suck at my job. lol", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTE4VEmzzpELiWKyHqp4NS9et2wMk9XJmkq8sLVfXSDHp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZvYJyam8gMXxMoowAto7MXCPym5LptANHkUUy7jGc7Rk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTE4VEmzzpELiWKyHqp4NS9et2wMk9XJmkq8sLVfXSDHp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

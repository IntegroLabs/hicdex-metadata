In the 19th century it was used as a breeding island for slaves and also for the disposal of prisoners. Today it has an exclusively tourist function.\n\nThis tomb has no name, no date, nothing that can identify who lives here, just a cross full of moss and plants that grow from the tomb that was already left behind.\n\nphotogrammetry scan/ 2022 - Higor Casagrande", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQTShKFfDCnuybsu1f9DocAW5oPQan5ULCuE4retxRtWy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWZFPn5R6c1p7m1sf2LfMvYs8dfF8R5LaJewGosh27Yyd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQTShKFfDCnuybsu1f9DocAW5oPQan5ULCuE4retxRtWy", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1UKFCFfRw6yz8p2tJvxd9ykT7ML9rX6mHj"], "tags": ["3DSCAN", "CEMETERIE", "GRAVEYARD", "PHOTOGRAMMETRY", "DIGITALART", "3D", "SCAN", "3DSCULPTURE", "SCULPTURE", "NFTART", "CRYPTOART"], "extra": {}}

I was supposed to be off-duty.  Yand\u00e9: Me too. We have had more calls than usual - they must be backed up at the Pangool.  Roog: I told Fama they need to start recruiting more healers.  Yand\u00e9: Terraforma is a tough posting dude - I don't know if I wish it for more people.  Roog: Easy with the empath reframe program. You are going to fry your system.  (They both laugh.) Roog: Seriously though, stop downloading every Pangool program they release. You can be more selective. See things for yourself and learn so you can make your own programs.  Yand\u00e9: I am not trying to be assigned to Terraforma forever. I need to keep up with the new programs for interviews. They always test on them.  Roog: I feel you, (leans in) but all I am saying is, the original program was learned ... Yand\u00e9 (interrupting): ... learned, not uploaded, whatever. Roog: Whatever? Whatever the fuck ever? Yand\u00e9: Goddamnit! Every time. How much is Denzel's Ancestral Trust paying you?  Roog: Free screenings baby! Every time I say it, I get to watch one of his movies for free in AR for 30 days. Yand\u00e9: (chuckles)They will do anything to not give people tokens. Stop lecturing me on programming philosophy and start working on your tokenomics game. You are getting ripped off! Roog: I might be, but I love the guy man. Tokens or no tokens, I can be a fan.  Yand\u00e9: Are you done yet? The last COMMAND is about to go out. I gotta get out of here in 24 hours to feed my winter moss. I don't want any delays. Roog: You haven't started harvesting those yet? You about to be cold as hell this winter. And you'd think predictable weather patterns would help people plan better.  Yand\u00e9: Are you done or not fam?  Roog: Don't worry, Fatou can lend you some - her winter moss was on a roll this year.  Yand\u00e9: Roog!  Roog: Ok, ok, I am ready. Pipe up, Yand\u00e9-Fatma-Fatma-Coumba-Yaye.  Yand\u00e9: You no better than to speak my full name in vain.  Roog: (tauntingly) But you like it.

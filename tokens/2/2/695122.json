When they finally solidified their line up in early 2006, plans to release an album was voiced later the same year.\n\nIt would took three years until \u201cA Brand You Can Trust\u201d was finally released, and the reason is Danny Boy\u2019s refusal to have members collaborate via email. He insists that everyone involve have to work together in person at his studio in LA. This is nearly impossible since each members is working on their own solo albums in different cities, as well as going on tours and various other commitments. The hardcore old-school approach pays off when the album finally drop. It features fifteen tracks with appearances from Snoop Dogg, Bun B, Sick Jacken, B-Real, Sen Dog, Immortal Technique, Big Left and Q-Unique.  \n\n\u201cA Brand You Can Trust\u201d definitely have a lot of throwback vibe to it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the posse cuts, the stacked guest verses, or the never-ending homage to substance abuse, but the album feel a lot like a 90\u2019s joint. Mid 00\u2019s was the rise of independent underground hip hop as they completely breakaway from the mainstream to create their own thing. Now that is all great, of course, but some of the artist kinda took themselves too seriously. The music became too dark. The content became too heavy. This album brought back the cheerful joy of old-school ghetto violence. When guns, bitches and cocaine were enough to filled the entire lyrical quota of a full-length album. And even though rap and hip hop is so much more than just those things, it\u2019s still sure is nice to be reminded of those times.       \n\nBox features A Brand You Can Trust cover art.\n\nFigure is made from Toypanic\u2019s skeleton figure, Blitzway\u2019s Jay Dilla Donuts Edition figure, Coolrain Lee\u2019s Dunkeys figure, Pete's PaintWorks 2pac figure, and a Studio One's 1/12 hoodie.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS6VTUB3y2YNjxY8F2ZfRhLZ8L15fghSvPkLHwsntMTZb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRhHqSiJSb9SE3DSqQzyCEdbHLqUgc5sJjpZ6QpNdi52M", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS6VTUB3y2YNjxY8F2ZfRhLZ8L15fghSvPkLHwsntMTZb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aXpmExefGTPY8Zw8WtaLyKK7AzdsvbZw2"], "tags": ["Digital", "Collage", "Hiphop", "Albumart"], "extra": {}}

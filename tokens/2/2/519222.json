My mother always tells me that as time goes on and you live longer and longer, time moves faster and faster. She's not wrong. As i move through the 2nd act of my life, I'm seeing and understanding how time is relative in the universe. Though to be candid, the act of getting older doesn't equate to time moving actually faster, it just allows you to pay attention better to details and how the flow of time works. I'm not a scientist, nor do I claim to be \"smart\" per se, but it is fascinating to learn about how the force of gravity can warp spacetime depending on the mass of the object that rests within a certain point in spacetime. From my lamen mind it almost appears as if time moves faster because gravity becomes greater and greater, like water going down a drain. So in the work, we will assign the right hand side to have a higher gravity than the left, creating an imbalance. Words from the left begin to get pulled towards the right. Eventually, everything goes away and becomes something else and then something else and then something else, and so on until a duration of unimaginable time passes and eternity ends in lightless, soundless nothingness.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVLqYDREWvmaZjM4ZWFqEK8CCNAqQd3tLRzTiRjNhSN85", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV53UNy3n27teSJSJn2ZsaHBSBghwxYVVe6anrqyL4FVi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVLqYDREWvmaZjM4ZWFqEK8CCNAqQd3tLRzTiRjNhSN85", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

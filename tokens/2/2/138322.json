We will also use cartesian coordinates to simulate its displacement and above all, it will think from other angles natural facts like the self and its materiality. The precursor concept of this perspective will be eZ == {vector that will define the amplitudes} in the different interfaces constructed by homo faber, phenomenas moderated by media narratives, techniques and electronic circuits, under the logic of the Teleputer. This distinction is important because there are other vectors that allow mediating the matter / virtuality arrangement.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYhss7gTQ4coFHN3iJcJEs5kSJifEPPca3cEjTzBz8oPQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP9vQi7aoDsobhDmg5K1dKsVjLZgonSxveoHT4W4LaQLo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYhss7gTQ4coFHN3iJcJEs5kSJifEPPca3cEjTzBz8oPQ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fBQygvkAdakywX8eoRDJjpr2x3VovSdk4"], "tags": ["self", "virtual", "reality", "materia", "philosophy"], "extra": {}}

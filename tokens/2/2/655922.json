{"__version": 1, "token_id": 655922, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BEYOND THE BLACK RAINBOW", "description": "BEYOND THE BLACK RAINBOW is a reference to the motion picture of the same name, directed by Panos Cosmatos. It's one of the most interesting films I've ever watched. The basic synopsis of the film is a heavily sedated woman with incredible ESP tries to escape from the hidden concrete compound where she's been held captive. It's like nothing you've seen before and there are scenes that will boggle the mind. Watch it just for the visuals alone; an unforgettable experience, only to be followed up with Cosmatos' film that followed this one, MANDY. I wanted to used the name in a way that descended into the darkness of mental illness. I might do a variant of this one and use a different technique in the future to give more of a 3D feel to it, but I'm satisfied with this version too. The mantra of this mandala draws you into the black rainbow. And can we just talk about how wickedly awesome the concept of a black rainbow is? Just try to imagine in your mind a black rainbow.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXL27TZ8zZfLQd2R8kYrNcwgiJ8G65gY7Ym7JKvC8Bzrc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW56cCRdvR5dt4WeqN7VG5EnGbTu9fH9wYQUtRAfMPoT5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXL27TZ8zZfLQd2R8kYrNcwgiJ8G65gY7Ym7JKvC8Bzrc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

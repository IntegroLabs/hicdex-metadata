The word \"Kapre\", or Cafre in Spanish comes from the Arabic word Kafir, which means non-believer.\n\nAccording to Dr. Medina, this Kapre gave the General a magical rune or amulet, that will make him immune to bullets and help him win his war against the Spaniards.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQptKswyh3sz4X7wtQSiFMQBFYyq1vVybrJK1cDdWmVmi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZrQStWKhvYWxBKkv94gk8wzTX4DVkDjHB8GbMsgYF1B8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmeH6ANZwzJdX4WfZttTU8J9nV2NgaAF7688vGeFbkZYB2", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQptKswyh3sz4X7wtQSiFMQBFYyq1vVybrJK1cDdWmVmi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1i83CcM14NwbPFrR5TDg8xfzZdUCWrgu2E"], "tags": ["digitalart", "illustration"], "extra": {}}

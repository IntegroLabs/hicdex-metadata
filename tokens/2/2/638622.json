What happened that day in Washington, D.C. was a stain on the literal foundation of democracy. How can it be that so many people thought they were doing the right thing? The reality was a devastating horror show that the entire world watched in real-time. Our allies gasped; our enemies gloated. HOMEGROWN TERRORISTS is an anagram poem for our age, our time; a time capsule of memory. That day truly brought out the worst of humanity and the very best. We witnessed brainwashed Cult 45 members destroy, loot, tarnish, maim, and kill. We witnessed courageous law enforcement try to hold the line and bravely perform their jobs. We witnessed what America had become; a manifestation of a metastasized schism in love, logic, and loyalty; truly a moment where hate and it's cronies strewed and emoted real horror on humanity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQKKx8jyabJdEWim613MdJDNnVffBH3F9ftq4zbbXCBcg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbtLVp4puKXoUQqzCXA5sUg8Vz5YHiCZQeYXaj5mrcddt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQKKx8jyabJdEWim613MdJDNnVffBH3F9ftq4zbbXCBcg", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 142022, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "MASK", "description": "Masking is a process in which an individual changes or \"masks\" their natural personality to conform to social pressures, abuse or harassment. Some examples of masking are a single overly dominant temperament, or humor, two incongruent temperaments, or displaying three of the four main temperaments within the same individual. Masking can be strongly influenced by environmental factors such as authoritarian parents, rejection, and emotional, physical, or sexual abuse. An individual may not even know they are masking because it is a behavior that can take many forms.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQAsvzAMZxee22opvZ5MCUxWUKNf12TJGrDqLwzPkC57m", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXyEMP9mDVQqUtQZU1iC8M6tgtLteDnsdAq5dhGCUQbjQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQAsvzAMZxee22opvZ5MCUxWUKNf12TJGrDqLwzPkC57m", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1TtFDQR9WRzug6YdNsBczvAmZ9F4nVT581"], "tags": ["2DART", "ANIMATED", "ANIMATION", "PAINTING", "DIGITAL", "MASK", "MASKING", "MENTALHEALTH"], "extra": {}}

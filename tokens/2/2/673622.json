Then I'll look below and all I can see is just roofs of houses that I didn't know the story of. It's probably lonely and cold too. Now I understand why birds fly and still choose to land, why butterflies fly in just a short period during their life cycle because real life happens on the ground. Human interaction is something that I should not take for granted. Down here, life is so much more meaningful.\n\n3000x4000px \nwatercolor on paper & digital illustration \npersonal use only", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNy9XyJVVB2UaX2UMNFL4Y3HbNF5Xi7fpqT2ibYVCpjjg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNy9XyJVVB2UaX2UMNFL4Y3HbNF5Xi7fpqT2ibYVCpjjg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNy9XyJVVB2UaX2UMNFL4Y3HbNF5Xi7fpqT2ibYVCpjjg", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1in4couQZK9vTAWUaCdSVNGLdfYuEr7eB8"], "tags": ["watercolor", "digitalart", "GIF", "nftcollector"], "extra": {}}

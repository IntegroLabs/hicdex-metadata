Not only is he a great artist, but also one of the nicest people I've been lucky enough to meet in this crazy NFT world. It's no surprise that someone so cool, makes such cool art.\n\n\nIt was a little difficult to teach Baismon skateboard tricks, but we managed to keep him from getting hurt (barely... he almost broke his clavicle).\n\n\nWe also built him a drone out of legos, so he could help him hold the aerosol cans.\n\n\nDon't forget to check out Bisman's work on his profiles and networks. He has a collection of cards with his main character \"El Chanta\" and another profile where he uploads comic strips and beautiful posters, with a very clean touch\". \n\nTWITTER: @YoungBisman\n\nHEN PROFILES:\n\nYoungBisman\n\npibetezos\n\nyb_rule_1", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTer4Ses2Ebwy6FquVaJaqrJoefvMLoD2EHxsR8WBA6et", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTer4Ses2Ebwy6FquVaJaqrJoefvMLoD2EHxsR8WBA6et", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTer4Ses2Ebwy6FquVaJaqrJoefvMLoD2EHxsR8WBA6et", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1bVAmmj5cK4s5SAMJFPWieFeTozMiZydJE"], "tags": ["illustration", "cute", "metaverseedition", "gif", "YoungBisman", "pibetezos", "baimo", "envelstein", "collab", "HEN500"], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 700222, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "POETRY IN MOTION / POETRY IN EMOTION", "description": "For this work, I wanted to take two of the most over used phrases in poetry and combine them to create the most interesting version of them. Hundreds, probably thousands (all speculation of course) of poets have referenced the term \"Poetry in Motion\", whether in their works themselves, or as titles of those works, or in articles writing about their work, etc. It's such a clich\u00e9 statement that I'd be remiss if I didn't try to do something with it. Well, interestingly enough this work is part of a poem in motion (if printed out, all the images from this series would create a long chain that infers movement.). This series is also \"Poetry in Emotion\", all works are subtle emotional poems. When we combine these two overlapping and played out statements, we create a new paradigm of context.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSjCpPDSytLQ1XPghEQSiagAP5NHb44N59Us5CtZwfQsB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTXYQgkKHNRMR9m91RzaZmqr7fAMuoAXjy9RRFQikwVLA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSjCpPDSytLQ1XPghEQSiagAP5NHb44N59Us5CtZwfQsB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

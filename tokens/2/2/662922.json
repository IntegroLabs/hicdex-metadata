There are absolutely no bad trips, even from a \"bad trip\", if the set and the setting are valid and protected, you can learn something. \"Many subjects report that, as pleasant and beautiful as the celestial worlds were, they learned far more from the demonic worlds - including, of course, the fundamental lessons for getting out of those infernal states of consciousness.\" [Ralf Metzener, in the book \u201cWorlds W and Worlds Beyond\u201d].\n\nThe artworks of the series \"Visions of light\" by Gianni De Martino are linked to the aura of the Psychedelic Revolution of the 60s and 70s in Tangier, Marrakech, and Essaouira in Morocco. As Walter Benjamin writes in \u201cArt in the age of mechanical reproduction\": the aura of an artworks is a concept linked to the \u201cHic et Nunc\u201d of the art piece, to its being inextricably linked a place and a specific historical period.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfAEAZWMUV2AEDjj6TdhvcwReQy1sSx16Woof64SRvqSd", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma5L6mjSAG6vxdQdjER8dY8ZxgSPVwAcLcSWypMPzf1Ed", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfAEAZWMUV2AEDjj6TdhvcwReQy1sSx16Woof64SRvqSd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gqxu5tmTiRh2EG3sEiuNaCRjJszPgmJR1"], "tags": ["acrylics", "drawing", "trip", "psychedelic", "lsd", "morocco", "visionsoflight"], "extra": {}}

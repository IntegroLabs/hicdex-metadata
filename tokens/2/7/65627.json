I created an almost exact NFT analogue of the arcade video game Pong, which was developed by the Japanese company Taito Corporation and released by Atari on November 29, 1972.  This is a huge step for me because it opens up a lot of opportunities to develop and experiment with paintings and collaborations with other artists. More to come!","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmQ74mvs6jAhDWvAP9CZCPkPSgFUfWJ1PNppUxuE8baqDN","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1RDSWHivfm8uyurzBUCKZmtvp3XqQnR2CZ"],"tags":["Pong","Interactive","Game","Ping","Black","White","Circle","Arcade","Pixel","Animation","Flow","NFTART","NFTGAME"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/svg+xml","uri":"ipfs://QmQ74mvs6jAhDWvAP9CZCPkPSgFUfWJ1PNppUxuE8baqDN"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmXfAW4DFRNZiU2rK6XS8trjtH631P6jdoEwyC1gAkJixS"},"supply":"100","transfered":273}

Since I've been working on this collection every day I started to notice that if I took new photos and included them in my design that a time capsule of that day was created. Years from today I'll be able to look back at this design and it may trigger a recollection of exactly what I did on Sunday October 24, 2021. And I have hopes that something about this collection connects with you in a similar way.

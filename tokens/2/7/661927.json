{"__version": 1, "token_id": 661927, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Waves Masked and Multiplied by Circles Scaled by a Noise Value", "description": "This animation is made with Nodebox. Nodebox is a node-based visual language for generative art based on Python. It is a loop of 200 frames with a resolution of 1000 x 1000 pixels. \n\nThis is a \u2018plottable artwork\u2019. Which means it can be drawn by a machine: a penplotter. I am happy to deliver a physical drawing after purchase. A purchase from this edition of 100 serves as a token to order a physical pen plotter drawing of a single frame of the animation. Because of this every drawing is more or less unique. This offer only applies to the primary market.\n\nIn this case transfer 10 tez to florisdejonge.tez (from the same address as the one owning the NFT) to cover the materials and shipping. Feel free to contact me via twitter.com/floris_de_jonge or instagram.com/dejongefloris/. Pictures of plotted designs can be seen there as well. \n\nThis design is plotted with white Rotring ink using an Isograph 0.6 pen on ClaireFontaine Troph\u00e9e Black 210 grams A4 paper. Because a pen plot is created with a real pen on real paper the physical properties of the material contribute to the appearance of the artwork. Therefore small imperfections are part of the work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUetHAGSpGjeNGTuyPVfVb1cfaaUSWK1adL3o9H9JJM3F", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQGZdw8mxS2D9Z2A2pxDHVH9sBMMVCq8o1naAaB8P8mcb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUetHAGSpGjeNGTuyPVfVb1cfaaUSWK1adL3o9H9JJM3F", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SHteAqHWkCUKvHGTNScNyuZLw4vd43jse"], "tags": ["Generative", "plot", "penplotter", "svg", "vector", "pattern", "geometric", "physical", "IRL", "NFT", "monochrome"], "extra": {}}

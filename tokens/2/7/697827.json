The word \"TEIA\" was written in 10 different fonts, and this was used as a shape/filter layer, as in the heart, star, and chaos/order videos. This clip shows a portion of the resulting video, with some added effects. Modified black & white versions of 3 of these logos currently are part of the teia logo rotation.  \n\n\nGenerative artwork created procedurally in Photoshop using custom macros and scripts. Post processing in After Effects.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVFTGNXGKiC1Z3C28LMdmJrFZaZAPyfausysW7sVfJxtS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWMxFC5Au4pzx95CGUCCuQpUbdHZRdcVTV6zPRRVC3sQP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVFTGNXGKiC1Z3C28LMdmJrFZaZAPyfausysW7sVfJxtS", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2Ki87XPuPNysbdmrJPfgx1xYvBBudow4vm"], "tags": ["abstract", "digital", "generative", "rainbow", "rgb", "animation", "video", "glitchart", "trippy", "photoshop", "psychedelic", "blackandwhite", "b&w", "teia", "teia700k", "teia700000", "700k", "700000", "hen700k", "700kOBJKTs", "color"], "extra": {}}

It's hard to imagine a conscious mosquito, right? It's good that life turned out to be short\u2026\n\nI hatched hungry. Very hungry. The only desire was to eat. Warm. Liquid. Many. Very much. \n\nThe search for the victim did not last long, flying away from my swamp, I headed towards the hot glow. As I approached, a feeling of fear seized me.

When we become caught up in a pastime, we lose track of time and the people around us. As though nothing is more essential than the objective seen on the horizon, and we have a limitless supply of time.\n\nThe trouble is, you think you have time. When we reach the end of the route, we discover that the objective is no longer present. In truth, we had no clue what we intended to do or accomplish.\n\nWhy squander your time with uncertainties? Why should you quit if your hand is an artist's hand? Let us construct something that will go down in history. Death is merely another adventure; without death, the world would be a different place.\n\nWhy squander your time with uncertainties? Why should you quit if your hand is an artist's hand? Let us construct something that will go down in history. Death is just another journey, without death, there will never be birth and life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWY1rzawAfNHgbBjZLBtwCgcK1UUvnjU2nin4Z7gFYEn7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWY1rzawAfNHgbBjZLBtwCgcK1UUvnjU2nin4Z7gFYEn7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWY1rzawAfNHgbBjZLBtwCgcK1UUvnjU2nin4Z7gFYEn7", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1c4877LKefgvcybmzmiADscz3NjDCAoY8R"], "tags": ["Illustration", "Philosophy", "Meta", "abstract", "skull", "death", "world", "life", "animation", "digitalart", "digitalpainting."], "extra": {}}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 536127, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "NOTHING IS FREE, EXCEPT DEATH. NOTHING IS FREE, ACCEPT DEATH.", "description": "Is there truth to the words here? That nothing is free except death? Certainly there are things in life that are free, but when you eliminate many other superfluous things to life, the one real thing in life that we all receive at some point is death. Do we take this truth and fight it tooth and nail? That is definitely a truth to ponder on at least one moment in our lives. That's more of the obvious truth, we all know at some point, we're destined to return home, but what is the bigger truth to be had here? Maybe the bigger truth is to be open and honest with our inner-minds and accept death as the most natural consequence of life. Once you accept death as not just some random, far away concept and that it's always around you to a certain degree, the world and life open up to you. Everything becomes alive and electric. The small and quiet moments are just as important as the big and loud ones. Though the meaning of life is completely empty and meaningless, what we do in our lives and how we live them gives them purpose and meaning to us. So when we say: NOTHING IS FREE, EXCEPT DEATH, this is the easier truth to swallow than NOTHING IS FREE, ACCEPT DEATH. Understanding and accepting are two sides of the coin of death.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU1nnyVRd8GZJ7JE2mbjKmJWDaQUS8kGn1Y9Y3Cj3n8hd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVbDBztUgVDs1Jwor5stwLFLWP6Gy6cxu9KV8ZXhj2b4u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU1nnyVRd8GZJ7JE2mbjKmJWDaQUS8kGn1Y9Y3Cj3n8hd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

Ramon Keimig's digital drawings show imagined exhibition spaces, fictional works of art and performances that defy clear interpretation. His work is dedicated to the field of visual experimentation, self-sampling, and exploring the limits of the artists own formal language. Through the process, Ramon Keimig negotiates psychic conditions with his environment.The imagery is oscillating between figuration and abstraction, both digital and analog, to explore simulated, subcultural codes and circling around interpretation of reality itself.

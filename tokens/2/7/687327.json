This is the 4th piece in the Monochrome Designs \u2014 Pink \u2014 and evolved into something quite a bit different than what I have been doing. I sought out to build some kind of face or semblance of one and as I isolated pieces of photos and laid them out this disjointed mammoth, totem beast creature started to emerge. I wouldn't say I'm a horror aficionado by any means but I often find myself watching these films set in foreign countries where some tourists end up stumbling into an archaic ritual that never ends well for them. Many times there is a paranormal aspect to the happenings and always makes me wonder, how much of this type of stuff is really occurring TODAY, AND, how long can a community continue with such practices if they are isolated and self contained? And if the they were exposed to the modern world, would they be more scared of our life than we are of theirs?

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 677327, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Madame C\u00e9zanne", "description": "Of the four portraits that C\u00e9zanne painted of his wife wearing a shawl-collared red dress, this is the only one to show her in an elaborately furnished interior. Seated in a high-backed yellow chair and wedged between well-placed props that seem to bend to her form and shift to her weight, Madame C\u00e9zanne is the lynchpin of a tilting, spatially complex composition. The mottled blue wall, the dark red band that edges the wainscoting, and the mirror over the fireplace at left identify the setting as the apartment that C\u00e9zanne rented at 15 quai d\u2019Anjou, Paris, from 1888 to 1890.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPpzZs75SHsft4KxQsEfqBAiCjh82wNMB4TUEi3X8Tjo3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTHnUmPv6QpCp5ZJ8qkbL2sjH8GruBD4SPjSdUgiwf1c1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPpzZs75SHsft4KxQsEfqBAiCjh82wNMB4TUEi3X8Tjo3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NCr4Q8ryHn4BrSyGfz56QUXcCDJ53Mzr7"], "tags": ["art"], "extra": {}}

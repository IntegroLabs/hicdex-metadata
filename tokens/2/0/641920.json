This work is about feeling like you are a watered-down version of yourself or who you could be. About feeling like a moth. \nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV2TfXgv3wxT7ZhJGGGPwB9SNjy9xrdrkRtV2MYk3m5wc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV2TfXgv3wxT7ZhJGGGPwB9SNjy9xrdrkRtV2MYk3m5wc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV2TfXgv3wxT7ZhJGGGPwB9SNjy9xrdrkRtV2MYk3m5wc", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours", "moth"], "extra": {}}

I made these spiritual tools for anyone to use. The runes on this item are used for protection of the spirit. The first use cleanses spiritual energy and the second creates a barrier to protect from further spiritual assault. Engraved into the bits of the given item is a prayer for protection and cleansing. If you feel like you are in need of some extra energetic protection, I am offering this trade to you. Make the transaction with the intention of using that energy to destroy any negative spiritual energy afflicting you. Say to yourself \"As I accept this gift, any negative energy attached to me will pass into the vessel.\" Then, burn the token with the intention of release. Say again to yourself, \"as I release this gift, so does the negative energy release from me.\" May your spirit be at peace, and may your intention to be free endure.","tags":["Protection","Cleansing","Karmicrelease","Power","Release","Freedom","Safety","Love."],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmZtyuyxqdgTWJF7L6hTFFNUhSvaBEf92j4SxfZfVRXwKj","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZtyuyxqdgTWJF7L6hTFFNUhSvaBEf92j4SxfZfVRXwKj","display_uri":"ipfs://QmcFmBY7QAXc635YyzAWXsooEWZXcJkYhqrpoQHvw9RWEi","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

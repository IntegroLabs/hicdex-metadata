Today's piece is me trying to personify the energy and excitement that flows into and out of this project. Doing a new piece every day means resetting the energy meter to 0 each day and then having to turn it back up to 11 again and again. It starts to come easier the more you do it just like anything, but it also becomes harder searching for something valuable to say. Bare sentiment....GO, do whatever you're thinking about now before it's too late. If you're scared, that means it's something worth doing!

I hope you liked it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWwKJft9A9Ri8FzH3BVk98o64YTdGEa9Aj2TshuYiW254", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNc4wyvuCQHUmUTinWYQrLZRrCPan6NKhn2gpKTNb7v2g", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWwKJft9A9Ri8FzH3BVk98o64YTdGEa9Aj2TshuYiW254", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1TumeokGU5E78MLBKaMDasVMkipiaBgUXN"], "tags": ["Hyperlapse", "Timelapse", "Cinematography", "Videography", "Photography", "Colombia", "Bogota", "Avenida", "Jimenez", "Colombia", "Sunset", ""], "extra": {}}

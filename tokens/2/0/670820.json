The figures presented are taken from the statistics we produce. By framing them, we place them in a new virtual museum, where we write day after day a new history of art under the prism of feminism. The Blockchain allows the inscription of these data in a durable way in the time and the History.\n\nOn September 23th, 2021, the Kamel Mennour gallery represented 22% women artists. Let's hope that their number will continue to increase in this direction.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQDL9n1PxNfuenccbSb9rU63BZTQQ69ta5eV3jAc7cMXj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbeNkqNj3xvpTbGb9HULJVzuuNZnJ2Hbpc6iqFQSCGABT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQDL9n1PxNfuenccbSb9rU63BZTQQ69ta5eV3jAc7cMXj", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz28a3vkLZKxSGaeWEAKghvU3jKfVHyxHWj5"], "tags": ["art", "feminism", "womenartists"], "extra": {}}

As stated on a previous page, negative space is so important to context. Where are the silent notes in my jazz score of art? Who decides where the spaces between the R and the A go? It's you, the reader. You decide on what you're reading. Think of this as something akin to those \"choose-your-own-adventure books\" from the 80s. I can't resist a good Willy Wonka quote, \"We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams.\" Just because I made the work doesn't necessarily mean you have to take my narrative. You can create your own. In fact, I love when people tell me they see a completely different story or thought in what I write. It gives diversity of thought and input; a true conversation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTABud5LbNHZDx91F4bHgNoV9RUsrAcWKQdX5HY7AxR3m", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW7AoEhHXunKCx2PwoATBL66o8Xgwgrp3ka1fcmHgcrU4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTABud5LbNHZDx91F4bHgNoV9RUsrAcWKQdX5HY7AxR3m", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

In the case of The Naked and Famous, we can specifically trace back their namesake through 2 other bands and their songs. Ready to go down a seemingly useless rabbit hole of a journey to music knowledge? Good me too. So our journey begins with the UK based Trip-Hop recording artist, Tricky. Tricky recorded a song in 1996 entitled, 'Tricky Kid' and within this track he might have referenced a song from the band The Presidents of The United States of America. They made a song in 1995 called 'Naked and Famous'. Either you absolutely love this one or now totally hate me for it. Either way, now you can't unsee it...you're welcome; my job is complete.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaJsgpY81eKRXyTuzBHPSQjDgJLWZJ284G7rk3PUXYZoM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbzkiTjshERub4oUgMFev8WQK72GqkqcyNGNVzBdRrEri", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaJsgpY81eKRXyTuzBHPSQjDgJLWZJ284G7rk3PUXYZoM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

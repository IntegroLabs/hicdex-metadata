Its effects typically include intensified thoughts, emotions, and sensory perception. At sufficiently high dosages LSD manifests primarily visual, as well as auditory, hallucinations. Dilated pupils, increased blood pressure, and increased body temperature are typical. Since LSD binds to dopamine receptors in addition to serotonin receptors its effects are also more energetic and fast-paced compared to psychedelics such as psilocybin, which is not a dopamine agonist. LSD is also capable of occasioning mystical experiences and ego disillusion. It is used mainly as a recreational drug or for spiritual reasons. LSD is both the prototypical psychedelic and one of the \u201cclassical\u201d psychedelics, being the psychedelics with the greatest scientific and cultural significance.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYz8sLv7cvKnrCEXn3riiftKdrLTXAjcKNydumEUpXQpQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYz8sLv7cvKnrCEXn3riiftKdrLTXAjcKNydumEUpXQpQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYz8sLv7cvKnrCEXn3riiftKdrLTXAjcKNydumEUpXQpQ", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "drugs", "collectible", "LCD"], "extra": {}}

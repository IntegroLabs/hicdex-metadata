The ones who binge, the ones who purge, the ones who are tormented by the psychological battle of what they see and what is real. Having issues with body dysmorphia in my past made me go to an extremely dark place. I was certainly not myself for a period of time in my life when I was obessessing and refusing to see myself for who I really was. I missed out on many things and lost some relationships with people I cherished. There are humans who deal with this mental horror day in and day out, and it may surprise you but the most fatal mental disorder is anorexia nervosa with a fatality rate of around 10%. Please, if you are struggling with this, even in the slightest bit, reach out to a mental health care professional who can help you. I know it\u2019s hard, and I know it\u2019s scary. You are loved, and you are seen.

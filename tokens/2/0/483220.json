Dubbed Psylocybis, this creature spends its time half submerged in the water, draining in nutrients from any life that touches its root-like tentacles. It is able to close its cap to more easily blend in with the surrounding trees, making this creature incredibly hard to spot.\nWhen this creature is encountered you have very little time to escape. It will emerge from its hiding, opening up its cap, revealing its haunting grin. It has the ability to levitate approximately 5ft from the ground, enabling this creature to have an even higher ground. Once over-head, spores are released from its hymenophores that, when inhaled, will cause immediate paralysis, hallucinations, and asphyxia, leaving its victim motionless and defenseless. Only few have escaped an encounter with this being, unfortunately having suffered immense psychological damage, they would slip into insanity shortly after finding safety.\nTO REITERATE DO NO ENCOUNTER THIS CREATURE AT ALL COSTS!!!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSFJpPdD9FfhPmggzHY7n6HbSYqsajqqFJaApzoTkTFEs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZuX7BJFJFFWTGuQcpuh1Du9Vg35Y2BD8572Dhzg56eKA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSFJpPdD9FfhPmggzHY7n6HbSYqsajqqFJaApzoTkTFEs", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LhWhC8FFDwRVe2P1Cf2fzHoGvu1DeBPNf"], "tags": ["crytpid", "fungi", "monster", "digital", "illustration", ""], "extra": {}}

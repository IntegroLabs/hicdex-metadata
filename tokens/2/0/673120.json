The category of this data set is \"Landscapes (with people)\". My understanding of landscape here is extremely broad and would be better described as exterior shots, so I might end up splitting this data set for my film.\n\nIn contrast to what I could find through the data set I used for girlsGAN.gif, the colours I find here are not as intense and mostly a variety of blueish-grey and beige-orange, often resembling winter or cold sunrises. For this sequence I also chose more abstract scenes reminiscent of landscapes and less those with vertical figures.\n\n(For a few more infos about my currently ongoing Experimental Film project see \"girlsGAN.gif (1)\", OBJKT#671021)\n\n:: {2022} :: @annaxmalina :: annamalina.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbcsPLvzMC7AAu4A5HMYZPwy43WRBbVWSufsWfhidWusE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbcsPLvzMC7AAu4A5HMYZPwy43WRBbVWSufsWfhidWusE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbcsPLvzMC7AAu4A5HMYZPwy43WRBbVWSufsWfhidWusE", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Up3Uyj6PR3AkdsaXouhhetS3VdaTkW2Ro"], "tags": ["gif", "animation", "gan", "annamalina"], "extra": {}}

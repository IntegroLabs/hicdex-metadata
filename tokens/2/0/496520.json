We are used to dividing everything into bad and good, beautiful and ugly, good and evil. But, in fact, if you think about it, all imaginary differences are just sides of the same whole. Nothing is certain and everything is mutable. Today you call something evil, and tomorrow you realize that it's only the branches of the tree, and you haven't seen the root before.\n\nI made this artwork when I lived in India. I was teaching at a college there. We had a fine art department in our building. There I met other local teachers who taught me the traditional method of graphic art - woodprinting. First, the work is carved with special tools on a wooden board, then covered with paint and printed on a special machine under great weight on paper or other surfaces.\n\nAll 4 corners are framed words. The words: \"Paradise\" in Russian and \"Hell\" in Sanskrit - on the white side. The words: \"Sun\" is in Russian and \"Moon\" is in Sanskrit - on the black side. After each word there is a question mark, asking us if what we thought was dark is really dark and what we thought was light is really light. I also used two different languages, expressing a call for friendship and understanding between people regardless of their cultural backgrounds.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYWbcNfXETfQNVhed9fTzG6QoV6kjWome6MZrREsRfc3j", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTr4brub4ZJH3aVsQY1csohUSR2FcRwKm4EzERZZsRKaP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYWbcNfXETfQNVhed9fTzG6QoV6kjWome6MZrREsRfc3j", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UtRwbfy93CpgaMrSmVp5SrxhDotYqExjb"], "tags": ["yin-yang", "duality", "sanskrit", "opposites", "god", "unity", "spirituality", "wisdom", "woodprinting", "blackandwhite", "graphic"], "extra": {}}

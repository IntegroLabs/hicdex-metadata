Think of the whole piece as an album, and each fragment as a song ;)\n\nIn this visual diary we visit places in Curitiba that are not the same nowadays. Of course, everything changes... But for example, fragments 4 and 5 show what used to be an abandoned space of what used to be an old house downtown, near a shopping mall called \"Esta\u00e7\u00e3o\". Now the whole thing is demolished, it will only exist in these records and I knew this when I took the photos in 2017.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcX1hSvS5g5Ru7y4Pc3iDcAuYmHoc723kssvJPdp3ixBi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeoNrRZ3AP86ZSUjWcAupgVPxTEQhDRPYeoRzBNTTRESD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcX1hSvS5g5Ru7y4Pc3iDcAuYmHoc723kssvJPdp3ixBi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PtvQ8NA2ZAazJR351GSjvJ6GUcRTwn8Zs"], "tags": ["photography", "streetphotography", "fotografia", "colagem", "collage", "diary", "journal", "diario", "brasil", "brazil", "dxxx", "streetart", "art", "arte", "graffiti", "pixo", "cwb"], "extra": {}}

The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.","tags":["Algoritm","Art","Generative","Random","Gif"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmaEwEUcc3azYTNpFzWUGpSac7AdgbHyRpnvmabLoT81ys"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmaEwEUcc3azYTNpFzWUGpSac7AdgbHyRpnvmabLoT81ys","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

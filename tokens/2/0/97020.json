One day, when he was running from one of these spectral creatures, he tripped and hit his face on a rock and his eyes started spinning at an extreme speed and ended up going crossed. He was rescued by FREAKOLOCO!#41 and taken to the hospital. After five years in a coma, he woke up with the idea that he could be the best blacksmith in FREAKOLAND! Now he works day and night making armor, weapons and other tools for FREAKOLOCO-41 and other warriors. We think he has great eyesight for this, but his skin can't take the extreme heat of the forge and gets full of disgusting blisters, so we always have to buy extremely expensive ointments and get him drunk on Brazilian Cachaça. Hopefully, some idiot in Ryrule will donate a Kgoron tunic.

Realizing that\u00a0language had become a monetary unit, I wrote this text about \"Semantic Capitalism\", where the most expensive word is \"free\".\u00a0As a by-product of this censorship, I became an artist in less than 24 hours and the \"Google Adwords Happening\" was then exhibited all over the world.\u00a0About twenty years later, we have finally shifted from the golden age of net.art and the indefinitely reproducible ready-made to the ultimate semiotic market of NFTs and the death of equivocation.\u00a0/ ArcheoNFT - Printable 15x35cm -\u00a0The webpage is available at iterature.com/adwords.

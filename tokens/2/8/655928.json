In \"LONESOME\", we can see how each word is stacked upon the next and how they line up directly with the original word, LONESOME, below. Soft, subtle, and simplicity = elegance. During many of these moments of societal solitude, I've found that loneliness and being lonesome have actually been something positive for me. As an introvert, I've had endless points to reflect and assess aspects of my life. Being lonesome, doesn't have to be sad or depressing; it can help recharge your mental, physical, and spiritual batteries; just open your heart and mind up to the possibilities of changing your paradigm.

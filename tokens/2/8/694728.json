He lives mainly underwater, but can also fly because he knows how to control gravity. \n\nHe spends his nights in the open air, where he communicates with the many planets of its ancestors. He sends and receives information collected about Earth's oceans and other oceans all over the universe.\n\nIts color is luminescent out of the water, a reaction to the very white light of the moon, but under water he is white and pale blue.\n\nStory by Emily Wergifosse\n\n\nThis collaboration project was set into motion by a last minute pairing in a community event called Blinddate in February 2022, where two artist were randomly paired to do a collab project together.  The very first project was a unicorn in a bubble.  \n\nEA, @EaEAa10 (Twitter) lives in central United States and is an illustrator working on paper with markers, chalk and colored pencil and Looly @EmilyWergifosse (Twitter) lives in Europe working on the computer doing fractals.  We have come together to bring you this series, which could never have existed in any other world.  Thank you to @rblbab, @teroseso and all of the members of the Tezos community who encouraged us to continue this collaboration.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWgoBcat6mtLhauZ16SJU525wNPA597cxUMxL4zu83SsY", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmbdk6LSKPKAdGWgPDd7K3XiPv2XWPSwpi3fjNKq4swGNW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWgoBcat6mtLhauZ16SJU525wNPA597cxUMxL4zu83SsY", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1WXyjNf4zXQq4hUgRePWjxZsMcnWyo86oL"], "tags": ["ice", "ball", "fractal", "illustration", "story", "fairytale", "Frozen", "frozenworld", "stingray", "manta", "mantaray", "sea", "ocean"], "extra": {}}

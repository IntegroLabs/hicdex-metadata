Her proposal to create a digital interpretation of the wedding bouquet, fit nicely into my studies of contemporary flower arrangement at the time. The concept of extending the inherently temporary quality of a flower through the digital process and photographic print was intriguing. This concept has the potential to be infinitely extended by skipping the print and accepting the digital asset as the work in itself. This painting was produced as a single cibachrome print before the process was discontinued. I feel that the NFT holds the potential to complete editions that have been cut short by the discontinuation of photographic processes. Since there are currently no rules & an active dialog around this subject, I am staking my position by releasing these works as I originally envisioned them, managing the editions with the same care as I have managed the printed editions.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVFeMq7vegfZLeYo128MKjKUcu47pSHz4HFDSGbSnRLLc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTT1fMaeLTkmcvYRbmUPaJwYqArksC1Pnu3Kzc7bsQ4hE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "is_transferable": true, "creators": [ "tz1dmg96RoGHGbKydeKDaqxsmvkT26QPR7vz" ], "tags": [ "fizzpop", "stilllife", "digital", "contemporary", "painting", "art", "commercial", "flowers" ], "formats": [ { "mimeType": "image/png", "uri": "ipfs://QmVFeMq7vegfZLeYo128MKjKUcu47pSHz4HFDSGbSnRLLc" } ], "token_info": { "@@empty": "ipfs://Qmc617QMK6e3XHm5STkjKxwrgvtQviZAMvMozp5ZcPRZ38" }, "supply": "25", "transfered": 0 }

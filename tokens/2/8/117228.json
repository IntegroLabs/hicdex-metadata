The Queen (or lady) of Hearts symbolizes nurturing, compassion, almost always a loving, caring, protective and dedicated woman for those she loves!  For this water tribe in my head it didn't make sense that it wasn't inspired by the indigenous tribes of Brazil, this sensitivity together with the immensity and richness of the waters of Brazil go hand in hand, I hope you like it!","tags":["Cards","Collectible","Collection","Queen","Hearts","Indigenous"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmPtt94nTzoJ89qYZAXBo9aTCyRh179S8wqapNMnRty4mu"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPtt94nTzoJ89qYZAXBo9aTCyRh179S8wqapNMnRty4mu","display_uri":"ipfs://QmcFw1eo2cFtxxBNBVNyCjAsLLmFVQfcUQXtQBJoDuL6Db","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

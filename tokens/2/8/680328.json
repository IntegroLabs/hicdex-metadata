{"__version": 1, "token_id": 680328, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Seneca Falls", "description": "The first wave of feminism took place in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, emerging out of an environment of urban industrialism and liberal, socialist politics. The goal of this wave was to open up opportunities for women, with a focus on suffrage. The wave formally began at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 when three hundred men and women rallied to the cause of equality for women. Elizabeth Cady Stanton (d.1902) drafted the Seneca Falls Declaration outlining the new movement's ideology and political strategies.\n\nIn its early stages, feminism was interrelated with the temperance and abolitionist movements and gave voice to now-famous activists like the African-American Sojourner Truth (d. 1883), who demanded: \"Ain't I a woman?\" Victorian America saw women acting in very \"un-ladylike\" ways (public speaking, demonstrating, stints in jail), which challenged the \"cult of domesticity.\" Discussions about the vote and women's participation in politics led to an examination of the differences between men and women as they were then viewed. Some claimed that women were morally superior to men, and so their presence in the civic sphere would improve public behavior and the political process.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZXd6meYU9HpAfFjJiTJ8MukDdwkuiCi2eHU2cvYnYCKE", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma8R4m23FATYin1XgM9FbQUW4rTECYniDqbFG9ijTJ3MC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZXd6meYU9HpAfFjJiTJ8MukDdwkuiCi2eHU2cvYnYCKE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dWC1aKp8vfiFBAC7tZSigyTiumVrWFcwM"], "tags": ["SenecaFalls", "woman", "womanrights", "humanrights", "human", "feminism", "ladies", "digitalart", "minimalart", "abstractart", "psychedelic"], "extra": {}}

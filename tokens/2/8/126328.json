These are monochrome abstract landscapes influenced by the concept of “mind landscape” which is a cultivated landscape burgeoned in the time of the Yuan dynasty. In this classical Chinese tradition, abstract landscapes are created as a mirror of the artist’s heart and mind; and have no relation to the visible world. The generative landscapes are produced with the same concerns but with modern computational techniques; composed with randomness. The search is for a place where the mind stays away from the chaos of images and associations.","tags":["Generative","Chinese","Landscape","Random","Noise"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmZ473HEmG6eBuFPLkfFif7Yph5vKg9aQAeYDBZdVMrKKn","mimeType":"video/mp4"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZ473HEmG6eBuFPLkfFif7Yph5vKg9aQAeYDBZdVMrKKn","display_uri":"ipfs://QmeqVhPMW9TYG9MVmBPhWfyJebJEdcZHStKsScby73H6cM","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

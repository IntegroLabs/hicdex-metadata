{"name": "Unclaimed Landscapes 06072021 variation 2", "description": "(1280x1280px) Unclaimed Landscapes is a series of generative artworks varied on noise algorithms. These are monochrome abstract landscapes influenced by the concept of \u201cmind landscape\u201d which is a cultivated landscape burgeoned in the time of the Yuan dynasty. In this classical Chinese tradition, abstract landscapes are created as a mirror of the artist\u2019s heart and mind; and have no relation to the visible world. The generative landscapes are produced with the same concerns but with modern computational techniques; composed with randomness. The search is for a place where the mind stays away from the chaos of images and associations.", "tags": ["Generative", "Chinese", "Landscape", "Random", "Noise"], "symbol": "OBJKT", "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmZ473HEmG6eBuFPLkfFif7Yph5vKg9aQAeYDBZdVMrKKn", "displayUri": "ipfs://QmeqVhPMW9TYG9MVmBPhWfyJebJEdcZHStKsScby73H6cM", "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "creators": ["tz1Yupp82eDiRrLcMnr3abMVM8BdAFX9jEkE"], "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ473HEmG6eBuFPLkfFif7Yph5vKg9aQAeYDBZdVMrKKn", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "decimals": 0, "isBooleanAmount": false, "shouldPreferSymbol": false}

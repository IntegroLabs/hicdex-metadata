The law gradually became eased until around 2000, but some restrictions still remain today. U.S. non-military exports are controlled by Export Administration Regulations (EAR), a short name for the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 15 chapter VII, subchapter C.  Encryption items specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted or modified for military applications (including command, control and intelligence applications) are controlled by the Department of State on the United States Munitions List. -wiki","tags":["CRYPTOARMSRACE","crypto","ITAR","FEDERALPRISON","FINES","fine","UNITEDSTATES","REGULATION"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"ipfs://QmYgaFYY68YQ7NmP79aq3TZbjJE9xEw2L4NwxzxoY44UaZ"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmYgaFYY68YQ7NmP79aq3TZbjJE9xEw2L4NwxzxoY44UaZ","display_uri":"ipfs://QmanovBNWtpZ1QpJWSREVed5z9DRAEzYNNj9vz2Grhbcz1","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Dead bodies is the place they love to nest. Once they are in they recover the remaining nervous system and so they take over control of the body. They communicate to each other through their quantum telepathy skills all over the universe without any delay. Balantosis is leading his race into war against all lifeforms. Their target is to eliminate as much as possible of the living to receive more dead bodies for their breedlings.","tags":["pixelart","cga","collectibles"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmZTQEhWunr6YEi1iUvZcpSVgjSpqPuzGbdxMYzw4pXsdb"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZTQEhWunr6YEi1iUvZcpSVgjSpqPuzGbdxMYzw4pXsdb","display_uri":"ipfs://QmZTQEhWunr6YEi1iUvZcpSVgjSpqPuzGbdxMYzw4pXsdb","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

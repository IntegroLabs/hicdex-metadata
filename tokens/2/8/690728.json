We will forever remember the world of now days in two parts: before and after. Terrible events draw their boundaries on the map of time. Our time is becoming a territory in which different opinions, conspiracy theories, propaganda, and the feelings of ordinary people are fighting on different sides. I have always dreamed of stopping time through photography. Now I dream of returning humanity to a territory where there have been no terrible events yet. Beyond the boundaries of time.\n\nFilm photography from personal archive post-war Abkhazia in 2007, boundaries 2022.

This is the 4th piece featuring my personal toy collection this time from a creator named Studio Uamou and her super cute mascot Space Boy. Uamou is a Japanese designer and this is the Dino version of the character and was purchased at Designer Con in 2018. Her style is quite minimal and understated and she has a vast array of toys of varying sizes, plush and other merchandise. I first saw her stuff when I had a booth at Designer Con in 2013 right across the aisle from her. I spent hours staring across the way at all her amazing figures and kept finding myself drifting over, looking them over and eventually buying SEVERAL figures and have been a giant fan ever since.

This Ouroboros only manifests itself in the company of the bleakest drudgery. Endlessly soldiering on in banality, the Poverty Trap Ouroboros barely sustains itself, but it only does just enough to keep going for another dull spin round the wheel, another day, another month, another year. An eternity. It represents the degrading sacrifice of time and health given by so many for so little. The cycle of debt and deprivation in perpetuity. It is the renouncement of ambition. Imperishable and undying the Poverty Trap bends round and round and barely notices its sciatica anymore.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfBCnga6Gui49kz6b5eEv6KJTARmaW9y9QDbWpvX6SqNq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVMbe2gta38zykKdQiXsg3pGFyDckHs79dRhvdzFsPEvi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfBCnga6Gui49kz6b5eEv6KJTARmaW9y9QDbWpvX6SqNq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iRMYqSEbDavLcBemntHaLVejXUBuk8o1Q"], "tags": ["povertytrap", "Mythology", "Ouroboros", "Dark", "Dingy"], "extra": {}}

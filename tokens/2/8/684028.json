But here, there are multiple particles interacting in parallel, depositing color and changing their motion and internal state according to a randomly initialized neural network. The view continuously zooms in, showing the history of the particles' motions at the edge of the cloud. @ngutten\n\n1024x1024 mp4", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfZdDmu1bv1WRVcG2PFC1rDdidfLaq7qkA6iV83QuxKp1", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma3jsoRrKDrpMYtoFu1gPx3uV2EZVv2L9PhD1XPxXv4ux", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfZdDmu1bv1WRVcG2PFC1rDdidfLaq7qkA6iV83QuxKp1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SWsPUdLvr4KCuZxN69ju2bZruggLbYhjx"], "tags": ["simulation", "tunnel", "psychedelic", "swarm", "neuralnetwork", "cellularautomaton"], "extra": {}}

In doing so, we've successfully created JUST IN TIME. This kind of visual poetry is similar to some of my earlier works like: THE SPACE BETWEEN US, LOST IN SPACE, LOVE TRIANGLE, etc. where the physical placement of a word defines itself. These types of scenarios are some of my favorite things to think about. Works like this don't happen that often for me, but when they do...it's almost magical. Something that references itself to define itself is something a text-based conceptual minimalist is constantly looking for. Although, these seem incredibly easy on the surface, to come up with these on such a minimalistic scale is quite difficult. How do you take a concept or idea and visually represent it in the most simple and most elegant way possible to the world? It's all about getting the idea out as fast and efficient as possible.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVDm8DiALxctnpY1Wk5DoWCopSvzqMRdYcpKvYiH6Z3rc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVZcDriSG9Cr8pzwyWZZXCij5zu3MbZmFrw9FjyxcVvBq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVDm8DiALxctnpY1Wk5DoWCopSvzqMRdYcpKvYiH6Z3rc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}

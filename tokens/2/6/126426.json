Illuminator uses an optimistic approach in finding light in the darkness. We have no choice but to step into the increasing darkness ahead and to follow the mirage of light. Like a blind person, learning how to walk in the dark again we are learning how to live with the constant ruin of prosperity, our desires, loneliness and being away from the loved ones, love. This collection - alongside with all of the sketches and final works - is a bridge to the soul that we have neglected for a long time. The techniques used in all of them, the inspirations, the fantasy-like nature, the different choices of colour in each work are all there to create the experiences I have had living in the modern world as an artist.","tags":["Illuminator","digital","motion","illustration","dark","darknft"],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmPSaDP9UnLHHYn3g3HTqkyunWT6po5x6S1upj11wwrS3r","mimeType":"image/gif"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmPSaDP9UnLHHYn3g3HTqkyunWT6po5x6S1upj11wwrS3r","display_uri":"ipfs://QmPSaDP9UnLHHYn3g3HTqkyunWT6po5x6S1upj11wwrS3r","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

{"__version": 1, "token_id": 141526, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Atlantes and Turul", "description": "Subotica Serbia Public Library . Fall 2020 . The term atlantes is the Greek plural of the name Atlas\u2014the Titan who was forced to hold the sky on his shoulders for eternity. The alternative term, telamones, also is derived from a later mythological hero, Telamon, one of the Argonauts, who was the father of Ajax. The Atlante is typically life-size or larger; smaller similar figures in the decorative arts are called terms. The body of many Atlantes turns into a rectangular pillar or other architectural feature around the waist level, a feature borrowed from the term. The pose and expression of Atlantes very often show their effort to bear the heavy load of the building, which is rarely the case with terms and caryatids. Atlantes express extreme effort in their function, heads bent forward to support the weight of the structure above them across their shoulders, forearms often lifted to provide additional support, providing an architectural motif. The Turul is a mythological bird of prey, mostly depicted as a hawk or falcon, in Hungarian tradition and a national symbol of Hungarians.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ5xcpNkhN7cRBtqMrHvHAzVYaZeW7qcXWpxSSUxdRJBr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXFffEvpWLikWgq7oFwETd5yUqvqoiTm4D6T1dHgVcCbA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ5xcpNkhN7cRBtqMrHvHAzVYaZeW7qcXWpxSSUxdRJBr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hkBWwSr56KnHY3b9D9Vgnz5EEnLSLMaPe"], "tags": ["Photo", "photograph", "photography", "serbia", "subotica", "architecture", "motif", "motifs", "atlas", "pillar", "column", "library", "mythology", "myth", "statue", "art", "form", "balance", "composition", "beauty", "balance", "europe", "travel", "building"], "extra": {}}

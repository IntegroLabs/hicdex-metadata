Stop checking the lifes of those who are richer, prettier, happier, but fake. Stop watching the news. Stop entertaining yourself with crap. Stop watching the stupid face of the guy on the news, and the guy on the weather.  Stop watching those idiotic commercials of home products and feminine products.\nKill your tv. Kill it now. Listen to music. Listen to your intuition. Don\u2019t believe the truth.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaYRfZhhjuyaLonhX2uGxFHk1pV6mLwoQYeR7EYV1vJNm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVH4e8LV9Qu6zDV9hTBzHaevpt4FUQWLxMaDZzpMjUSFd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaYRfZhhjuyaLonhX2uGxFHk1pV6mLwoQYeR7EYV1vJNm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XoH3c1HsHDFjiTyrWqxHU4qZ6vPzmM1vK"], "tags": ["illustration", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}

But once the sun goes down, she rips her body in half and spouts bat-like wings. Under the cover of nightfall, she hunts for pregnant women and uses her snake-like tongue to puncture their wombs and eat the fetus inside. Sunlight is deadly to the Manananggal when she is in her Aswang form. If her two halves are still separated by morning, she will be destroyed.","tags":["manananggal","aswang","cryptid","monster","creature","mythology","myth","philippines","filipino","pilipino","pinoy","black","dark","illustration","digital"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmekcKc6JkQDsXW27nFY7V5KAabUi1Se3KSDfxvPpEcJ6q"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmekcKc6JkQDsXW27nFY7V5KAabUi1Se3KSDfxvPpEcJ6q","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Created by Sam Stevens (Dreams Lost In Time). Part of the on-going series, \"Event Horizon\". The concept of the Event Horizon series is to reimagine what energy could look like as it crosses the event horizon of a black hole, in some distance galaxy throughout the infinite universe. This painting depicts my vision of light crossing the event horizon of the black hole, Tiffany's Epiphany, otherwise known as NGC 4596.","tags":["Painting","Acrylic","VinylRecord","OuterSpace","BlackHole","DreamsLostInTime",""],"formats":[{"uri":"ipfs://QmZg4pCi1kj6TCbfMj4zqkrTdnm19FzRfwhMf7DMceBbg6","mimeType":"image/png"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmZg4pCi1kj6TCbfMj4zqkrTdnm19FzRfwhMf7DMceBbg6","display_uri":"ipfs://QmdcvcNo9UZACd4k6SH4shR1gJyn6LyimF6RmknJ652p6R","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

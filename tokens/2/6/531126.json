Allah is above and beyond all weaknesses, and infliction. He is source of peace and security for mankind. It is mankind that needs peace and security through Him. Breaking away from As-Salam brings disturbance and destruction on oneself.\n\nHe is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior. Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him. (Quran Surah Al-Hashr 59:23)\n\n\u201cWhenever they kindle a fire of war, Allah extinguishes it; and they strive to create disorder in the earth, and Allah loves not those who create disorder.\u201d (Holy Quran Surah Al-Ma\u2019idah \u2013 5:65)\n\nPractice and spreading peace yourself to increase your chance of going to Jannah:\n\nAbu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said, \u201cYou will not enter Paradise until you believe and you will not believe until you love each other. Shall I show you something that, if you did, you would love each other? Spread peace between yourselves.\u201d\n\nSource: Sahih Muslim 54 Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Muslim", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPXda64Uq42gXpYAtxwrQNU5GyYoGRfKvdYGgnxrEp1p7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR6dsMs1Mbav1TdNA7fYYCH9U95skAyiPsivygMvxqtmb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPXda64Uq42gXpYAtxwrQNU5GyYoGRfKvdYGgnxrEp1p7", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XKKqyhN7ka8Svg7DBe67hrSWVNcYnrFPM"], "tags": ["1of1", "moslem", "colorful", "allah", "religion", "god", "name", "asmaulhusna", "islam", "asmaulhusnanft"], "extra": {}}

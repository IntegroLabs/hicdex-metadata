Today, the highest manifestation of politeness is the refusal to meet with a master in a beauty salon so that a woman can use his services instead of a man.  Previously, the date was agreed after a few days or even weeks. Nowadays, more and more dates are being made retroactively.  They call and ask: \"If anyone asks, we had dinner yesterday, okay?\"   Each parting gives an expectation of death, and each meeting - an expectation of resurrection. Therefore, even people who are indifferent to each other rejoice if in twenty or thirty years they will converge again.  But.. will they be alive by this time?","tags":["HELL","PARADISE","PURGATORY","MOON","SOUL","WOMAN","BEAUTY","RENDEZVOUS","WHITE","BLACK","RED","NIMBUS","MANNERS","DISTINCTIVITY","DEATH","LIVE","FLIES","GRASS","KINKY","CRYPTOHAMSTER"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/gif","uri":"ipfs://QmVHUCdGw37dg7gPDaayBA9seAcDc7Fknfs9aJR7EwMbXp"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmVHUCdGw37dg7gPDaayBA9seAcDc7Fknfs9aJR7EwMbXp","display_uri":"ipfs://QmVHUCdGw37dg7gPDaayBA9seAcDc7Fknfs9aJR7EwMbXp","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

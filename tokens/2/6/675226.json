Working iteratively from a single template of blocks Burtonwood sought to explore formal properties of hue, value and saturation. Each work is painted on 8.5 x 11 inch paper using acrylic gouache. They are being minted on TEIA as 1/1 editions. A book of all the Color Studies together plus an essay by media theorist Patrick Lichty is available msg me on twitter for more info @tburtonwood", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYRk8Bs8HmveT5FP522HvdjzeRXFziwAdh27F5H5SLezz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeJ5WVhWVVU3hTDop2eemXyWSQjZSJaSjXpfjF8tbuPHj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYRk8Bs8HmveT5FP522HvdjzeRXFziwAdh27F5H5SLezz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QMRu8dCDNoAuGpMZRqBBBqW4zmyUq4wTS"], "tags": ["Colorstudy", "painting", "tetris", "repetition", "gouache", "tomburtonwood"], "extra": {}}

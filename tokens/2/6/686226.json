{"__version": 1, "token_id": 686226, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LEGENDAIRY", "description": "(Hmm...isn't that word spelled LEGENDARY?) Why yes. Yes it is. But we're taking some creative license on this one for a little fun. This particular word zipper is quite unique it has quite a few properties or factors that create rareness. Let's systematically go through them: 1. 3 separate valid words that zipper together: LEG / END / AIRY. 2. The first two words connect and form a unique word LEGEND prior to the 3rd word connecting. 3. The 3 words come together and form LEGENDAIRY, which obviously is a misspelled version of LEGENDARY. 4. When we take an even closer look the last part of the new word formed LEGENDAIRY, we see another new word DAIRY. This word zipper truly is a rare bird amongst the menagerie of the bizarro. Is this nonsense? Absolutely. Do I care if anyone care? Absolutely not. Is it fun to make these? You bet. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it.

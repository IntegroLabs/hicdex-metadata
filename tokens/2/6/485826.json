North America.\n\u201cThe Giant short-faced was a brutish predator that overwhelmed other large mammals of the Pleistocene with its great physical strength.\u201d\n\nEach frame of this mp4 file has been encoded with a segment of the sequenced DNA of the Giant Short-faced Bear. This video therefore hides the genetic code of the animal within.  \n\n#ExtinctAnimals is a collection of pixelated fauna representing the last specimens of species that disappeared from earth. Bright pixels, fossil records and genetic descendants are all we have left. As an NFT, each of these images is unique, finite, and scarce -- much like the last extinct animals they depict.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZNLzgidToyASWrU2R2aX63ZVqaLWdhQ61p5WN3QgWDum", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPN77kwNx9DZ9kY9y44ex8dkXgB9NqiQAtCc8J6mBMVz4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZNLzgidToyASWrU2R2aX63ZVqaLWdhQ61p5WN3QgWDum", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1NdE7FmyWQxLky7n2NpVaa2ioujTfqdigi"], "tags": ["Extinctanimals", "dna", "bear", "3d", "mp4", "pixelart"], "extra": {}}

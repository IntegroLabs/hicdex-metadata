I’ve been waiting so long. Cross the sea, cross the mountains. By the power you’re given just please get me out!  Take away all the pain, all the lies and the fable I'm a vessel of glass with a candle inside. We're rejected. So what, just please fall from the heaven And then take me away far from this wretched life. Do you hear? Take me into the sky Till kingdom come, into the sky","tags":["digitalart","photomanipulation","photography","fantasy","dragon","storm","girl"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/jpeg","uri":"ipfs://QmX2PYQXfcQot41gsRcimxqn5n2ELUEQcYybziPC5gWyNe"}],"artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmX2PYQXfcQot41gsRcimxqn5n2ELUEQcYybziPC5gWyNe","display_uri":"","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc"}

Quantity: 5. (To me death is this beatiful and pretty simple phenomenom that I can't seem to get away from. I love how skulls look in drawing and art pieces, and how some people feel discomfort while others just think it's fucking sick! I adore the fact that once we all die in the end we only leave our skeleton behind. No matter your race, gender or history, in the end we're all equal.)","artifact_uri":"ipfs://Qmf5JCzkod2rBUJfYqXiGgA822tj5PVJvfkFHQqKQHSRtT","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","creators":["tz1MBf79gQqpJRb4hoWGLy57N5SxJyQaDUE2"],"tags":["Artist:AlfredSwahn","Date:18/4/21","Name:\"Love","Death<3\"","Size:5120x5120",""],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://Qmf5JCzkod2rBUJfYqXiGgA822tj5PVJvfkFHQqKQHSRtT"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmU374iPHgMm8qcGSUeM9rcp2g3ZMdDVPsUq4f9QFCjufw"},"supply":"5","transfered":23}

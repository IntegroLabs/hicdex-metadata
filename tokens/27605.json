I don't mind using my tezos on that. And what are you talking about anyway? Like you didn't collect stickers and cards in the past. Where is all that shit now? All those cards of soccer players and that crap you collected. And don't say that I'm wasting energy. Like your printed cards didn't consume a lot of materials. Let me be happy with my NFTs.

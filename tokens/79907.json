In this song Kate is drowning somewhere at open sea and as fear and despair take over her she asks for death/sleep - \"Let me be weak. Let me sleep. And Dream of Sheep\". I see it all as a figure not only to someone who is actually drowning at sea but someone who is drowning with depression, anxiety, and the hardships of life as well. @chiba.arte","artifact_uri":"ipfs://QmXnVR967zp36vgEyR5mncfSsrv8sndvLZRid4dDxxHyAS","thumbnail_uri":"ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc","is_transferable":true,"creators":["tz1Xmn4aqBiKVkLfsM2Kne4BG5Sujf285r9D"],"tags":["watercolors","art","weird","odd","music","portrait","painting","nft","econft"],"formats":[{"mimeType":"image/png","uri":"ipfs://QmXnVR967zp36vgEyR5mncfSsrv8sndvLZRid4dDxxHyAS"}],"token_info":{"@@empty":"ipfs://QmdN8XCZtzfgYnHKsjwGhNhy3irzoBgLQFM8drS6CJvitE"},"supply":"10","transfered":10}

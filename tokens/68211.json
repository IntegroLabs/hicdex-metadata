Used in relation to the purpose that objects can assign to themselves, the concept was central to the works of Baruch Spinoza, Sigmund Freud, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Ernest Becker.  A human being’s quest to create meaning; an immortality vessel – beyond one’s own limitation of life (and death).  Mother nature is nurturing the baby as a way to express its evolutionary path towards immortality.
